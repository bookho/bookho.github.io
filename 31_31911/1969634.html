			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whed when Clarke was drinking in the pub, his best subordinates were The headquarters of Dongcheng was busy in the turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy car fled to the West City! They are between the third and fourth walls, the fifth National Guard and the Third Division have invested in three The strength of more than 3,000 people in the regiment is chasing and intercepting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not enough! Not enough! To block the carriage that can ride on any surface, you need more More people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the self-directed interception of Wiener; Betsy kept the latest battle report. The three regiments have nearly 200 spell users, but most low-level spell users face the ability of the two on the carriage to be completely unobstructed. Whether it is Isaac's light and gravity, or Jeter's sacred ruling, it is easy to break through the general defense network. The elite of the division is limited and can only be deployed on the wall to prepare for interception - but the current situation is that the other party may break through any point in the northern wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the new troops kept coming, alleviating the shortage of troops. The southwestern regiments successively reorganized the team and returned to the team. The inland river fleet also allocated more than a dozen sailors to assist him in blocking. Of course, the most reliable reinforcements were Betsy's third and ninth divisions. The arrival of these two forces made Hull happy – even if they took the credit, he didn't mind now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We chased the troops after receiving the contact with the lieutenant, and they followed the night after Robert. The main force has already strengthened the defense of the North City, I bring The rest of the people came to stand by."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two green-collar workers were a strict major, wearing a blue gendarmerie uniform. Seeing Hull’s face is suspicious, he explained: “I was still infiltrated by the rebels last night, and I haven’t had time to change my clothes yet. Also, should Betsy leave the 'explosive gun’?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this is the case. Are you one of the two special shooters? How do you call it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull solemnly solved the two guns from the layer of protection magic. Given that the weapon is too dangerous and can defeat the resurrection magic, these three special weapons were permanently sealed after the unanimous consent of the politicians of the Republic. The major took the gun and carried it directly on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sain; Constance. There are no two, because these two guns are for me. I am leaving, thank you." After a military ceremony, he turned and left. In the tactical preparation room outside the door, he met Anne and Nanimen who were rushing back from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sain!" Seeing him here too, the boy exclaimed; but the gendarmerie just smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The past is over, and who is going to see it today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After leaving this sentence, the major quickly walked out the door. Naimen wanted to catch up and explain, but Annie took him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about him, he doesn't have our latest information. If you want to talk big, let him go." She approached Hull's desk. Interrupted the conversation between Hull and the staff. "I just received a report from the guards near Dongsanmen, and there was news of General Lopez. He is mobilizing the troops at the East Gate to support the North Gate battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Hull was overjoyed. "If Lieutenant General can also support, we will have a lot of odds! Then we have to send troops to the North Gate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne shook her head: "No, my judgment is not like this. According to the people who saw them, the General’s lord and his daughter were on the same horse, with a few The guards below. The soldiers below don't know about this, but I think the lieutenant colonel should know what you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Yanika?" Hull could not help It lowered the voice. "She has been here for half a month! How is this possible? Is the general really with his daughter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, There is probably a problem with this. As for the question of authenticity, I and Sorrento just happened to be in the East Gate. What is certain is that at least 黛Card; Wei Lun is my Clade I suspect you have been convinced that his daughter "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;.. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Herrtle thought and raised her eyebrows: "Even if you are really with Yanika, what can you explain? Your argument is too unreliable. The general met her daughter, so she decided to leave the dangerous pursuit. Sex is even bigger. Besides, isn’t you and Yanika’s home in the vicinity, lieutenant?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s not very likely, but everything is I am afraid that the fact that they carry a few guards is very strange. What if the monica is really working for the empire? In the unlikely event that General Lopez decided to guard Govar escaped from family and personal interests. What about Nie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie sighed. She can't say the real reason: she knows history. In her future, there are five records of the legendary woman’s treason. The person who opposed her called her “chameleon” and “witch”, and the person who worshipped her called her “the Madonna of the New World”. If you know your friend, 黛妮卡; Lopez is the one who is a nickname; Wei Lun, she will definitely put her on the list of dangerous people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pay attention to your speech, Miss Sefer. The general can't do that kind of thing!" Hull reflexively sinks his face to refute. But he also felt that this possibility could not be ruled out, he added: "However, we can't rule out the possibility that the imperial mages used strange new magic to dress them up. After all, those people used this morning, we don't use us. The magic of knowing. I dial one... No, a pure cavalry is giving you, you are responsible for tracking this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In fact, not the empire's cutting-edge magic It was her own invention...) Anne quietly thought, taking the order from him. She turned her head and called the boy, and they quickly left the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everyone left, Hull rubbed his face and stood up from the table and walked back to the map. On the map of Lenny, the northwest direction of the watch tower is red, and each tower is constantly reporting "observing the enemy"; while the rest of the area is quiet to an amazing level. In his intuition, if you do not consider the irrationality of the bait's powerful strength, this may indeed be a lure tactic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter. When they pass the big detection network, everything will be known."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He turned his gaze to the fluorescent blue line that enveloped the inside and outside of the fifth floor. The tiny red dots flash from time to time, which is the mortal or animal through this detection array. If necessary, this magic array can be extended to the outside of the city, or contracted inward to the third floor. When the great magical power passes, it will naturally react...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scepter that controls the change of the power of a squad is now in his In the hands. Instantly launch a new attack magic array near a certain section, which is not even the function of the Empire's "Oss River Detection Network". After all, the detection magic that envelopes the 1,000-kilometer border is not the same as the detection magic that envelopes a small capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to wait here until the breakouts appeared - this time is not very long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map attached to the magic shines. The blue fluorescent line is distorted and deformed; on one point, the red mans rises into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy broke out! Emergency alert!" Hull waved with his uninjured hand. "Raise reinforcements! The alert is near 30 degrees west of the North." Tower!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant colonel turned the jewel on the starting scepter, and the blue fluorescent line on the map expanded a circle. He adjusted the defensive intensity to the "enveloping magic" plus "paralysis", and the blue fluorescent line turned pale green. He selected all the warning towers in the northwest direction on the map, and used the flashing of the red magic warning lights at the top of the guard towers to send a code to inform Betsy of his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Decoding." The two people in the city and outside the city noticed the light at the same time. Even in the afternoon sun, the red lights flashing on dozens of warning towers are quite eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy, retreat, north west, thirty degrees. Protection magic, start, range, enlargement. Degree, third level."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert let a lieutenant around him copy the light rhythm and turn the password table to answer. In the command of "the enemy will be blocked by defensive magic, and quickly intercepted", all the free soldiers in the vicinity mobilized and rushed to the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the two people who triggered the detection of the array were standing on the city and translated the password. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac looked at the flashing lights near the top of the warning tower. Their black carriage stopped at the edge of the city wall and was very conspicuous. The blue and green people are coming close to the city wall, and they seem to be drowning at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Already ready, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet; Newton is empty behind him The carriage said, making the illusion that someone was sitting inside. The cardinal danced a whip, and the carriage rushed down the wall, rushing straight into the moat over three meters wide, ready to leap over the sky with gravity. Under the influence of the "surface gravitation" spell, this carriage can run on any surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ignite the moat!" From the wall more than 100 meters to the Wiener; Betsy loudly ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know when a light layer of oil covered the surface of the nearby moat, giving off a slight pungent smell that I couldn’t find without looking at it. It is not a black "elf water" traditionally used for naval warfare, but a brand new fuel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac and Jett were shocked and tried to hold the reins, but it was too late. Just before their eyes, the sea of ​​fire rose to the sky; two horses screamed and rushed into the sea of ​​fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of Fttil, let this water and fire separate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Extraordinarily high in the name of the goddess of fate, the light of the Holy Light from his hand. This holy light actually forced the separation of the moat and the flames above! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Army soldiers looked at the separated water and fire in surprise, all holding their breath. Even Betsy was stunned, and he had to reassess the strength of the other side. A few of the priests who believed in the Orthodox Church were surprised to kneel down, closed their eyes and began to pray; the Protestant pastors could not help but mourn the prayers. In the gaze of everyone, the carriage rushed past the bottom of the moat and rushed along the embankment to the other side of the river, rushing to the enchantment where the distance was enlarged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has attacked them; since the Fourth War, in the past two decades, there has never been such a powerful magic in the South. On the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Betsy lived a Orthodox priest who was praying and asked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest opened his eyes and replied in awe-inspiring tone: "That is the 'Grace of Heaven'. The greatest prayer, second only to the 'miracle', Only recognized cardinals and voters can get this kind of favor. I think that is a cardinal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cardinal... "This answer is beyond the imagination of the general. He had to start again to estimate the secret agreement between Klad and the North... The emperor actually sent a cardinal and a top-level wizard! Is it necessary for the entire Jules to be cast into the empire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No time to hesitate. He saw the black carriage rushing past the 300-meter close-range defensive line in the blink of an eye and stopped exactly in front of the defensive array. Two pick-ups jumped out of the car and studied how they were buried nearby. The ground of the loop tried to make a temporary hole in the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red light on the warning tower began to flash again, as if setting off the situation of this millennium. He signaled a staff member to decode and shouted the final trump card he had prepared for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Shoot the carriage. Only your weapon can accurately destroy it at a distance of three hundred meters. We only have one chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special shooter who came in put down the support frame and set up a name on the city head. The weapon of the implosion gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so much a gun, but a tubular magic cannon with a precise optical sight. It can only shoot one shot per fill, and all the magical power on the magic loop will be burned out and burned after the shot. He took a deep breath five times and held the fire after holding his breath for ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唰". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible line of action flies in the direction of the muzzle, in the middle of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air mass that gathers a lot of compressed air flies, and gathers a small group at the end of the line of action, embedded in the depth of the target like a bullet. Immediately afterwards, the air mass spreads out and refills the temporary vacuum around it, giving off a dull blast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betsy took the telescope from the side of Robert and looked at the carriage that was completely blasted by the implosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this all about projecting artillery." The first time I saw this secret weapon, the admiral couldn’t help but scream and couldn’t take his eyes. The ruins are removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage has disappeared completely, turning into countless "shraps" that are shot at the surrounding area, leaving only a large pit on the ground. Of all the weapons he knows, only twenty-four pounds, no, forty-two pounds of siege guns can leave such a large crater. No matter how many people in the car or how powerful the great magician is, it is impossible to survive under the direct attack of twenty-four pound shells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being hit by this weapon, unless there is grace, it is absolutely impossible to resurrect with any magic... even the Cardinal does not work, only the Pope And the voters can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pastor's muttered to Bezi's ear. The general returned and began to look for possible survivors - he believed that Govar was dead, but he did not believe that it would be so simple to kill a high-ranking mage and a cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where? All the smoke and dust have fallen, but no one can be seen, and no body and blood can be seen. As Becky struggled to find it, there was a screaming sound. He put down the telescope and found everyone looking up at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the above?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up will look up like the people around you, see There are two black spots floating in the air a lot higher than the city wall. He raised his telescope, saw the fragments of the carriage he was looking for, and Isaac and Jeter who were crossing the defensive magical array with the help of the wind. They also opened their mouths like the people around them, and they couldn't close together for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s that magic, the magic they used in the parking lot. They turned the blast into a driving force, and then used instant protective magic... Have they prepared instant magic to deal with this situation? That is, they are bait... Is the carriage empty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General, there The new password! The real enemy broke out from the East Gate!" The decoding officer on the side finally caught the opportunity to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this report, Admiral’s face became stunned. "Robert!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief staff touched the back of the head and had a well-intentioned mind: "It doesn't matter, I have already sent reinforcements according to your previous account. Please trust that person." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, Lenny East Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, what is that?" Govard, who made up "Klad", asked the flashing communication light at the gate of the city. "Can help me translate it." ", Captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's our law open. It seems that your order may have come too late...the other party has probably broken through "Oh," said the captain of the captain who guarded the entire east wall. "But it doesn't matter, we are the regular army, and there is a row of cavalry deployed here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned and called nearly 20 cavalrymen to the East Gate cavalry platoon. In the process of these guards carrying the cavalry, the Parker, who had not spoken for a long time; Tup suddenly noticed that there was smoke rising on the road leading to the west. He patted Shulan's shoulder and motioned him to turn back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian was also surprised when he saw it, and immediately told Govar. The former marshal heard it first, but then he resumed calm and turned to the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's show me the queue. I want to confirm your combat effectiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This serious tone, which cannot be refused, made the captain screamed: "Follow, sir! All down! Salute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant General Klad" nodded with satisfaction : "Turn left, one, two! Turn right, one, two! Turn back, one, two..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just turned around, Shangyu I immediately saw the smoke and exclaimed: "Lord, what is that? Is the enemy not at the North Gate?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the enemy is in the East Gate." Gowal replied slowly. The girl immediately behind him whispered to everyone: "Don't kill them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
