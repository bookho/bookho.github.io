No, even the prison will not deliberately build a room without windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More like... Princess in the tower? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is light here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft light shines from the walls of the four sides, not the light of the electric light, nor the oil lamp, nor the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only personal memory, not knowledge. In the knowledge section, there are these words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she knows that this room is not illuminated with these techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you say this word, there is an inexplicable intimacy. The method of changing the laws of nature with faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I" should be magical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the appearance of the steward, it is an invisible servant made up of magic, even magical creations that are not intellectual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how you look at it, there is no smell in this house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only magic. The magic that fills the entire building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... I should be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not "I", but I. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-focusing on the glass bed, the magic filled inside is simply showing off his sense of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn’t you notice it before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger pressed on the edge of the glass bed and suddenly felt a guilty heart, like a current rushing through the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fingertips feel the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While recalling the power of magic, the magical influx of arms along the arm, asking for permission from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is... Magic Net?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the word is spoken, there is a mind An alarm bell sounded somewhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it seems that I can think about why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Static field..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you read this magic name, you know Its effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magic used to save the soul without the soul - or the magic used to hold the most dangerous characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that these things didn’t make the mystery less, it became more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now even your own age can't even be estimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should probably be a prison here - a prison that is difficult for a top magician to break through or reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who did it for what reason...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's all powerful Dangerous character."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-sounding analysis of "self". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who finishes it all, waking up to him or her is an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse, I don't know how to get back to the previous state. Can't pretend that nothing has happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 13th, 1666<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west side of Fort Worth, Robert A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leader" wrapped up by rebel sailors Rear Admiral Daro Salami, half-squatting behind the sturdy gate of the warehouse, peered through the shooting hole to see the movements in the outer square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a major general, this move is not elegant, but he is really concerned about the negotiations that will last long in his future. His group of "consultants" who had just "transferred" from the rebellious sailor's leader also squatted on the blinds, observing the opposite action through the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before ten minutes, they had completed all the preparations and asked for negotiation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the chaos of the raging gangs was swept away by the gendarmerie, these rebel leaders remembered that as the center of the regime of freedom, Fort Vatican was not only There are big men from the 12 Freedom Division and the Seventh Fleet, and there are also 50,000 Army and 50,000 Navy. Now that there is a rebellion, there is indeed a chance to sigh, but a greater possibility is still seen as a chaotic army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure their own safety, they eagerly negotiated the negotiating conditions of no new ideas and lions, and in this restaurant converted from a warehouse Toss a lot and converted the restaurant into a "temporary flagship of the Orthodox Fifth Fleet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they were eager to wait for the response from the gendarmerie commander. This waits for a dozen minutes, and it looks like a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other party agreed to negotiate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone was relieved to hear this reply. Some people are nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who whispered: "He is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone Know who they are talking about. The commander of the gendarmerie is the most famous hero in this free war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small square in front of the warehouse is not too wide, and it was already riddled by the wounded and the broken soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as soon as the person came to see it, the large crowds were separated from each other in a panic, flashing a path for the coming. Even the savage sailors who were seriously injured were dragged to the roadside by their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't even bring a guard. One didn't bring it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if we don't have a guard, what can we do with him? I heard that even the emperor's book He dared to stop the team, it was a madman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even a madman, it is also a terrible madman. Do you want to stop in front of a senior madman officer? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the nearly desperate arguments of the staff around them, Major General Daro could not help but be infected with these emotions. It's like being in front of one of the most important business negotiations, suddenly I heard that the opponent has mastered all of his own cards -- no, worse than that. This is when I heard that the opponent has mastered all of his cards, and I heard that the other party will never give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything is quiet," the general cough coughed twice. "If you still want to live to see the next sunrise, vacate the hall, 'good' Meet our guests. Don't let me hear what 'mad people' are, it's not our negotiation strategy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they are talking about "madmen" "I am walking through the square and looking at the "mailang" that has fallen around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negman? Soledon is not interested in speculating on the ideas of the sailors. What caught his attention was the sailors who were involved in the transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pupils of the Navy sailors, fear, despair, dissatisfaction and helplessness are reflected. It was a creepy look, with only indifference and endless indifference. Those who are not fanatical and greedy mobs in his imagination, but those who think they have been abandoned by the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Army for so long, Nana has never seen such eyes in the eyes of officers and soldiers. Not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the world's strongest free navy? Why is this emotion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I always feel that something is wrong, but I can’t say it. The sailors in front of them did commit crimes, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memories of the oaths and the scenes in front of the audience resonated, and the door was flashed uncontrollably. The mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the warlord is the scabbard, and the gendarmerie is the whip..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...I swear to work for the well-being of all free citizens, to build a better Free Army and the Free Navy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his lips slightly, The oath in the memory was repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Better Free Army and Free Navy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen knows that he will not give orders for "blitz and annihilation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer stopped in front of the restaurant modified by the warehouse, raised his right hand, and knocked the door politely. At least 10 squirts of firearms aimed at him through the shooting rims set up in the warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the representative of the negotiations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, heavy iron The warehouse door was slowly opened up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a walkway in front of the door that is illuminated by a few faint magic lights. This walkway leads to the end of the hall, where there is a stage that is stacked in wooden boxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage was supposed to be an exposed oriental dancer, but now it has been replaced by a grass-rooted podium. The direction of the magic light is concentrated in the center of the stage. Three or five wooden boxes are put together to form a long table. There are several charts on the long table, and a sextant is still standing. I don’t know where these squadrons are coming from. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change sailors "supposed" on the walkway from the door to the stage, as if in the popular drama, the emperor of the Holy Emperor. Their standing posture is based on the Army's standards, very amateur, and it seems a bit ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the door did not laugh. He smelled a strong whale oil smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red single-sleeved military uniform..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can hear the whispering voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the stimulation of these nervous sailors, the goalkeeper removed his left hand from the pistol at the waist and slowly walked toward the other commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Report your identity, major!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebel sailor’s leader sits The side of the conductor table. He didn't wear military uniforms. He looked like a general, but his tone was very rude. Whether it is the age of forty, the slightly blessed belly, or the well-behaved beard, it proves that it is a person who has lived a pampered life on weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did such a person lead this transformation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was so stunned, and took two more steps forward, spread his hand: "Don't be so nervous. I am here to help you. You know me." Who is it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Daro frowned at the inconspicuous. The young man in front of him did not directly answer his questions, nor did he enter the rhythm of his negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him a little uncomfortable. But before he spoke, a sailor next to him violently inserted: "How do we know that you are not a counterfeit?! If you are that person, your medal?"<br /><br />&nbsp "Ah, do you want to see the evidence?" The door smiled and explained with a relaxed tone. The right hand slowly moved to the waist. "Don't be nervous, just show you evidence." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rear Admiral’s brow wrinkled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword in the hands of young people slowly emerged from the sheath, giving off a warm orange glow that almost illuminates the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword has been rumored in the recent market rumors, and every sailor has heard its description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this is enough to prove that I am the commander of the Independent Gendarmerie, the Intrepid, the Nerdy? Major Solonton."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is easy to use on the ground with a sword tip. The blade surrounded by orange light cuts into the floor tiles, just like a knife cut into cheese. This caused a stir in the surrounding crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, I have confirmed my identity, let me confirm the safety of the hostage. This request is not too much, this general? If it is inconvenient I can not ask your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Daro hesitated, and immediately the changing sailor screamed. He sighed slightly and replied: "The Fifth Fleet Defender Fleet... No, Commander of the Fifth Fleet, Rear Admiral Daro Salami. Sorry, I can't let you see the hostage until you promise us. Major Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to see the hostage." The door does not give in, "I will see you now."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Major General, can't let him see the hostages without permission...But we can't buckle him too!" The famous hard-working sailor couldn't help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daluo will snorted from the nose and screamed: "Don't mess! You know what happens if the major can't leave safely?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door smiled and picked up the words: "It won't happen. I will stress it again, I am here to help you. As an independent gendarmerie." Commander, I don't want to see more deaths and injuries. This will not add even a trace of honor. However, in order to be able to fulfill your requirements, I need to see the hostage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This time the Rear Admiral spoke before he interrupted the words: "Can't you agree to these requirements? Our request is not complicated. We will assign the original fleet of the fifth fleet to us, full of water and equivalent. The ransom of millions of pounds, and to ensure that the Red Fleet will not pursue us. You have the authority of the military and political conference, you can do most of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance Menner Sword returned to the sheath and looked at Daro with a deep look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this point, Major General Daro could not know the meaning of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked and sighed deeply, confirming: "Are you going to convince Pitt? Wayne Naval Marshal?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded noddedly: "This is the only way to solve the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing sailors face each other . They all know that they actually have no control over the second floor. I did go up some brothers, but those who did not come back to confirm the control of the hostages. It is not so much that they captured the navy marshal, it is better that the naval marshal and his guards did not choose to fight to the end. For a time, no one has promised to agree to this condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Lendaro also bowed his head and muttered: "Hostage..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Or do you still have no control over the hostages? With the power at hand, can you really make up your mind to fight against a naval marshal and a senior senator?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the door seems to be awkward, and it shocked the audience. More than one person pulled out his own sabre, or grabbed the musket, and prepared to tear his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the next words of Naimen stopped them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, I am here to save you! You want to be safe! You want the boat! You want to escape with the results of the plunder! But, you can Where are you going to escape?! Your enemy is the Free Navy! And behind you, there is not even a dock! Can you trust the empire? Or Saint Sen? This opportunity is very small! Only the Seventh Fleet can provide you. These are the things you want - you can even go back to the Navy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors’ heads stunned and exchanged their eyes, but no one expressed their attitude. The analysis of the door is indeed very reasonable, faintly said their fears: no one believes that thousands of people can be pirates, most of them are afraid of a rare end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door patiently waited for them to exchange their eyes, raised their fingers and pointed at the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me up! Since they are not willing to condescend to solve the problem of transformation here, then it is only for me to come out." Ningmen replied, "Can you please? Major General, will you take the road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Darrow looked around and saw that most of the sailors’ leaders did not raise objections, and they stood up and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor door is closed at the back, cut off The sight behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daro? Salami and Nanimen took a few steps and went up the stairs. The door pressure lowered the voice and said: "Well, tell me the truth now, Rear Admiral. I heard that you are involuntarily..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rear Admiral suddenly stopped and his legs were soft, and he slammed into the front of the door, with a cry in his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You save me! I am not a planner of metamorphosis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the door A flash of surprise on the flash, busy reaching out to help the Rear Admiral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if the Army and the Navy do not belong to each other, I am absolutely not worthy of 'Hello' or something..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Daluo still can't stand up, his tone is anxious and fast: "Now is not the time to say this, sir! I couldn't control the sailors. If they think the situation is not good, this warehouse will be the whole." Turn into a sea of ​​fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me about the situation on the second floor." Naimen directly cut into the core question, "What are the hostages in the end? How many people do you have? Going up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are about 30 people on the second floor, but no one is coming back. According to the concentration of hostages, some of the captives are quirky. Imperial people, former members of parliament, and senior officers of the army and navy. You must also suspect that there is some incitement behind this transformation, but we can't determine exactly which of these people are behind the scenes..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanimen and Darrow looked at each other and nodded in the same place. They put away all the enthusiasm and rushed in the direction of the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people wearing coarse cloth on the stairs, and the door on the second floor facing the stairs is still shaking slightly. They are not wearing military uniforms, and they can’t see the belonging of these two people. He looked at Darrow and looked down on the Navy Major General. He looked at the hands of two people and judged the identity of the two men from the crack and the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the sailor who participated in the transformation. It’s not dead, just fainted.” The Major General hesitated and said, “It seems that the other party has already predicted it.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I will come to them directly. And they have already estimated this and will follow the change of sailors here. The intentions of these people are really interesting. Yes, have you learned some sort of spell? Any system can do it, maybe we won’t go in peace.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Daro touched himself The stomach, smiled bitterly: "When I was young, I went to church school for two years, but it was not suitable for me. The magic net is probably too new for me. The navy does not need those low-end casters, only aiming at the range beyond the cannon. The mage can survive on the waves. For a major of the guard fleet, it will be more useful to operate the sea trade comparable magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Live your own necklace, press the sound to connect to the magic net, "Annie, I want a suitable illusion magic and detection It doesn't have to be too advanced, it can disguise my position, and it can detect the number of people in the other party. It doesn't need to detect the magic power. It is useless to detect it anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am not Anne, just a knowledge base." The familiar voice is still cold, but the words used in each query seem to be a little shorter than last time. "After the query is completed, it can be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the door is not good at detecting and illusion type magic, Magic Net is a big master of these aspects. supplement. Through the simplest magic and life recognition, his sight can clearly see the distribution of the crowds in the elegant rooms on the second floor through the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the arrival of Luo Shao will not be magical, and the door to the door will be described again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a group of people lying behind this wall, but only a part of them have a life reaction, it is estimated that the sailors have changed. The rest are divided into three... ...no, four parts, about seven or eight people leaning against the corner of the left hand, sixteen seven at the end of the right wall, more than twenty staying in the distance, and... and two in the middle of the room? This magic The reaction is completely unmasked. Are they fighting? In the changing sailors, are there any magic officers in the ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daro shook his head and denied: "I can't have it." Can you mix in the navy with the garrison mages, who does not have tens of thousands of gold pounds? They are independent of the captain. They are independent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Independent one?" asked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, you may not have read the regulations." Seeing that the door is not clear about this rule, Major General Daro explained, "Article 3 of the regulations, The Garrison Master can get 10% of all the bonuses and bonuses. Unless it is wrapped up, there will be no captains and garrison mages to participate in this unscrupulous rebellion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So, the one inside the 'high magic reaction' can't be yours..." The doorman scratched his hand in the air and pointed out the scope of the potential threat. "By the way, I want to ask, Who are the remaining nine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rear Admiral stumbled. Although he did not know the purpose of the door, he still carried the original text of the regulations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is any seizure in the naval battle, it is divided into ten. It is vested in three copies of the Parliamentary Sea Trade Commission, from the commander of the fleet to the commander of the sub-fleet. The captain took a single, the ship mages took one, the deputy and the second, and all the sailors were divided into three..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It sounds fair.... Why is there so much change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to these naval intelligences, the door is thoughtful Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kicked the door slightly at the door, opening the door and creating the illusion that his phantom was stepping into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom lips swayed with the sound of the door, and it looked perfect. In fact, he did not expect that these people in the house could really lay down their weapons and stop the attack, but the scene must always be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two "high magical responses" that were originally in the middle of the confrontation turned their heads at the same time. Before the two men stood on either side of a short table, faintly facing each other, but now they are staring at the door-to-door look that suddenly appears at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey. Do you dare to reinforce?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send a cold-hearted person I have seen it. His weapons and his tricks have also been seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s the refuted Oriental knife or his pirate dress, it looks familiar. It was a friend who used to be Anne - or Bonnie, who knows it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is Kay...but why is he here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like The pirate man sprinted to the door at the speed of the wind, and the sickle in his hand made a harsh scream. The tip of the recurve knife just stayed on the neck of the phantom made by the door, and almost smashed the phantom a little further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door hurriedly stopped their illusion in case they were seen. He noticed that there was some kind of epaulette of the free navy on the man's shoulder, but it was covered by the seaweed-like long hair, and it was impossible to see what class it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a changeable sailor..." The door continued to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with the sickle did not listen to what he was saying, but his wrist shook and turned his knife slightly: "Imaginary!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the person standing on the other side of the short table also moved. It was a tall man who couldn't see the face of the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the end of the door to remove the phantom, the man did not know where to pull out a huge two-handed sword, almost dragged from the shoulder to the ground . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the door to sigh, the big sword has been used at a faster speed than the sickle, and rushed to the wooden wall that the door is hiding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin wooden partition wall, in the face of such a large sword, is as fragile as paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole-hearted sword smashed through the planks, and the blade began to cut in from the door frame, slanting downwards, and the smoke and the dust of the scorpion were almost obscured. The sight of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smoke, an orange light rises against the trend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This orange light also cuts the wooden partition wall and traverses the route of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light flashed, the silver giant sword was quietly interrupted from the center into two! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an exclamation around the explosion: No one thought that the mighty sword was so broken. I am afraid that there is only one weapon that can do this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benevolence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp More than one person in the room called out its name. The number of people who can identify the name of the weapon from the visual and effect is not too much, which fully proves the high quality of the "hostages" in this large room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "benevolent" cast in the hands of the door is slightly stagnation, its ridge of the sword will fly the half-cut sword that is flying, and then it will be cut into thorns. Jianguang went straight to the owner of the giant sword opposite the wooden wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandon the sword!" The door was low and the right foot was on the ground to show that he was not malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the "kindness" in his hands kept going. With his arm length, if the other party does not retreat, he will be pierced by the mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the Great Sword has to take a step back. But then, the man picked up the half-cut sword in the air and immediately issued an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Double Sword Form!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round of attack and defense is faster than lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around the crowd just sighed for the fate of the great sword, but did not expect the sword-bearer to leave enough. Whether it is the volley to catch the broken sword, or the weapon deformation, it is greatly unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Stop! It’s not an enemy!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a gendarmerie!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the camps on either side of the room, there were such shouts, male and female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men who had played against each other re-formed each other across the ruined wooden wall and carefully looked at the opponent in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "benevolent" is enough to prove the identity of the door. Whether it is the sharpness of this weapon or the great achievements it represents, it will not be overlooked by anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sword, or the owner of the Sword, is a tall, silver-haired woman wearing a nun costume without a cleric logo, but it can be seen that it is the Northern Orthodox Church. style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swords in her hands are surrounded by silver light, and the purity and strength are very high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The characteristics of this metamorphic weapon, where I seem to have seen it... is it in Steelburg?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That exceptionally similar to Annie’s voice instantly answered the question of Nanimen: “That is the 'Covenant Arbitrator’. The most advanced blessing weapon in the Orthodox Church collection is that the chief bishop and the cardinal can give One of the holy devices of your choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't remember seeing this woman, but I must have seen the magical features of this weapon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orthodox nuns across the street seem to recognize the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a navy...the sword. You are the one who stopped the emperor in Lennie, took the 'benevolent', arranged for the retreat of Lenny Commander?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall nun pulled his hood down again, and the tone became urgent and fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." The other party suddenly got excited and let the doorman feel a little confused. "I am the doorman? Major Solton, to rescue the gendarmerie." The commander of the regiment. How many are the high-ranking priests of the Orthodox Church? Why is it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are deepening our understanding with the sects of the South..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are trying to strengthen communication with powerful people in the new regime of the South..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not only in front of The nun is saying. In the camp of the imperial people, another nun is also saying, but her statement is subtly different from the words of the person in front of him. The doorkeeper noticed that the priests who were sitting at the tables were wearing clergymen from the Orthodox priests, and they were subtly mostly women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter person said half, the tall orthodox nun suddenly turned and rushed back to his companions. The second woman who spoke was pressed back by the tall nun, and then nervously said something to the rest of the people, even half of the self-introduction was given up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is staring at this scene with a sly look, thinking: "They said that there are some weird imperial people upstairs. It’s true that my reputation should be Haven't you been able to shock the ranks of these senior priests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it were me, I wouldn’t trust these imperials, majors. Don’t worry about what they said. How nice, how sacred the appearance looks, or how big the chest is, every imperial person dreams of messing up your southern regime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the pirate man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Captain of the Seventh Fleet 'Ji Shui', Feng Jiangang, the school. Have you seen where we have seen it?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a similar feeling, but I can't think of it. Maybe we can have a drink later." Nike responded cautiously. "We still talk about business. I hope to see you." The commander of the Seventh Fleet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice gives people a feeling of straightness, but it does not allow others to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you remember this guy's Tessie name, this guy's Tessie name is Kazmi? Stihaus. Our seventh fleet is used to the oriental style. The name is convenient for local command."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is eyeing the coming. Unlike his original imagination, Pitt Wayne is not the captain of the domineering between the naval generals and the pirates, but a seemingly fifty-year-old, gray-haired brunette, quite a book Yellow-skinned oriental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the location of the Seventh Fleet and the history of pioneering ocean routes over the past few decades, Nanimen felt that this was not surprising. If it is not the fifth fleet that is almost completely destroyed, the Seventh Fleet stationed at Lingyangmen will not be withdrawn. This fleet is of course dominated by local Eastern sailors. It is not surprising that there is a naval marshal born in the East. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Clade Lopez can make a head in the Eastern Empire. Who else stipulates that the freedom of the countries cannot have a naval marshal from the East? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to find Pis? Wayne Naval Marshal, this name refers to me. But if you are a disciple of Luo Ruide, you should be able to call me directly. The oriental name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to use a word to summarize the impression of the naval marshal, it should be said to be "regular"; but his style of speech is completely It is naval, loud, straightforward, authoritarian, and one-of-a-kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contrast reached the limit when Nami heard his Eastern name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This handsome name is Wei, the table is too flat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door hurriedly adjusted himself The oriental language of the three-legged cat puts the name and the word of the person in front of it in the mind. He knows that in the Eastern countries, the surnames are usually from the father, and the words are from their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of person will set such a name for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but repeat this unusually domineering name and raised his hand to honor the military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Navy Marshal Wei Taiping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping patted the door The shoulders, but this gentle shot made the door almost three steps back. The naval marshal in front of him is not as weak as he seems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have solved the problem of metamorphosis, major."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded He replied humbly: "In a certain sense. This is the commander who changed the sailor's recommendation, Major General Daro Salami..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Turning around and pulling the stunned generals into the house. The previous round of offense and defense scared the Rear Admiral to sit on the ground and could not breathe for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the Fifth Fleet? His business, I will talk later. The change is not a big deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Wei Taiping just glanced at him and turned back to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you have another item. Take it out, that's the core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a slight surprise. He vaguely discovered that everything he did was actually in the calculation of the naval marshal in front of him. He reached out and took out the parchment roll in a metal letter tube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I brought the appointment letter given to you by the military and political conference..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wei Taiping It was "lightly" shot on his shoulder. Even if it is prepared, Nana will still feel that the shoulder blade is broken. In front of this elegant person, physical strength is even more amazing than the imperial female priest who is carrying a big sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No hurry. Let's sit down and have two teas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naval Marshal Others, striding into the elegant room. Naimen hurried to keep up with his footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
