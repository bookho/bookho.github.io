Central District 1<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am sorry, I only brought three hundred knights. You will be used as a 10,000 people, squat."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conversation took place in the standard calendar of 1666, which determined whether the second dynasty of Keman could continue the battle of destiny. Facing the barbarian warriors who were full of mountains and plains, the first commander of the Knights, and later the Duke of Sotaland said to the emperor who was loyal to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that Battle of Sotalan, three hundred knights broke through the entire flank of the Northeast Barbarian. The three hundred people seized the bullhead flag of the twenty-seven northeast barbarians and the three-sided striped totem tribal flag. Each barbarian team has 300 people, and each tribe has 600 people. The three hundred knights actually destroyed 9,900 enemy troops in the morning. Because of this amazing credit, the head of the Knight was named one of the five great dukes of the Second Empire, and the seal covers the entire northeastern region of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on this night after six hundred years, the head of the trial judge, said to his loyal emperor:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only sixty knights around me. Even if there are no more than 2,000 people, it will always be fine to deal with 800 people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Foreign Secretary Kewei? Hugh? Earl of Eagle Wings had 63 trial knights, plus 29 medical knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even on the frontal battlefield of Lenny or Kengler, this is a worthy awesome force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after being attacked by the commander of the Freedom Army without courtesy, he still has 57 trial knights and 28 medical knights. This level of sneak attack does not change the contrast between the two sides. According to the number of opposite torches and lighting magic, the Free Army is certainly less than 900 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, now the Cavaliers have plenty of support behind them. The senior mages and pastors on the steps of the library are enough to support the full attack of one or two emperors. In addition to the lack of ordinary soldiers as cannon fodder, this unit has almost no potential problems. They are able to cope with almost all forms of combat and are able to defeat almost all types of enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the war of attrition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the current situation seems to be shifting to a war of attrition. As soon as the trial knight rushed down the steps, they broke into a fan shape and rushed to different companies to launch an extremely broad front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the embassy of Gustav’s brow wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked his military minister, the Grand Duke of Figota, "What is the Cavaliers’ intention to do? Parallel charge? The other has a chapter of excellence, I am afraid not Ordinary national army, will it be too arrogant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90 riders to 800 infantry, sounds little difference in combat power, it seems to charge The area gap is not large, and the cost of the Cavaliers must be several times that of these mobilizers. Although only a total of fifty-seven knights are divided into two rows, the front of their charge looks as broad as the six densely packed infantry companies. Eight hundred infantrymen were filled with one side of the square. If there were eight hundred cavalry, their assault could shake the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from another perspective, in the parallel charge, each assault knight must face at least ten enemy muskets and bayonets at the same time. For those who want to break through the array of free military, this number will increase to twenty or thirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best knight, after all, is a knight. Most of the judges in the trial will only have a few low-level magic, and they are specially selected for the close match. Medical knights are good at healing and melee, but most of them don't treat divine magic outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke looked at the battlefield and immediately understood the plan of the Earl of the Eagle. He smiled and pointed to the battlefield and explained: "The trial knight is not the same as our ordinary cavalry. Now the two sides are not many and are all elite. The count is trying to show off the strength. You look at the medical knight behind. In the way of expansion, I know what the Eagle Wings wants to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Duke of Fegota has some flaws in his description. The emperor did not respond, he relied more on his own observation. He found that the medical knights of more than twenty running charges were not as scattered as the cavalry. The largest group has about twelve or three people, and they follow the horse behind the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav immediately understood: "It seems that the Eagle Wing is to confuse the enemy first, and then concentrate on the force to solve the other commander. This is just this The charge has already passed halfway, is it still too late?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like hearing the emperor’s complaint, the foreign minister suddenly raised his sword and pointed his finger at the left hand. The previous push, under the cover of the iron mask to protect the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wedges! Under the mask! Come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice sounds dull A lot. An orange light illuminates along the blade and eventually turns into a sacred flame that is entangled. The originally dismissed trial knights suddenly and horses, more than 30 rides followed him, and the swordsmen all pointed to the "superior chapter" commander of the left wing of the Freedom Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire array took less than 20 meters. Their arrays are as dense as an infantry array, and they can reach the shoulders of neighboring comrades by reaching out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black exotic wars summoned by the trial knights are intellectual. Only such a clever horse can form a rigorous formation like a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change in the empire's magician stirred up a burst of admiration, in the formation of the Free Army caused a low exclamation. Almost every recruit wants to swallow, but their saliva has long drained and can only barely make a few swallowing moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenmen? Soledon did not panic, but continued to stand in the middle of the team, shouting orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first company in the left wing, set the fire! Fight that orange!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance The door itself is very clear, he does not have the magic power of commensurate with a chapter of excellence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only hold four companies in the afternoon. The newly squadrons of these companies have not even remembered the names of the officers. They can only be commanded by each company relative to his position. Just saw the trial of the Knights' choice to break through the whole line, his heart almost jumped out of the blind eye, once thought that the other party had seen through his strong outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, in the end they are still concentrating on me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next His eyes almost jumped out of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, he saw that the chief knight of the enemy leader charged the orange sword in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orange light glowed in the air without any air, giving a crisp "beep" sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a joke... Is he kidding a bullet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orange Crossed over, flashed three times, and three more "beep" sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s an accident to get rid of a bullet, getting rid of four bullets is definitely showing off. The trial knights cheered loudly, even if they shot and continued to charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No horse slowed down, no one fell behind, and the round of fire shooting did not cause any results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it is the most sharp sword in the world, "benevolent", this is too much..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen also knows the source of the name of "benevolent": Because this sword is too sharp, the person who cuts his head can tell the complete words, leave the will, and hand over all the change on the body. Give your own sir, give your love letter and tokens to your best friend and spurt to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, your reserve team is in place as planned." The superb student Garnier's face is an admirable expression. "In the face of such an enemy, you can still be so calm, really amazing."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of others, the arms of the door are crossed on the chest, and the legs stand straight, which is completely a calm look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Less, your company doesn't need to command?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sparly Command. Our remaining strength is not much more than a company. I am a little bit more magical. Although not strong, it should also play a role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You will stay behind me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the door and look back at the team, the reserve team is indeed in the position he commanded. Unable to wait for Garnier to continue to answer, he continued to order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second wing of the right wing and the left wing are all three steps back! The rest of the good bayonet are on the ground, and the blade points to the enemy!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry is getting closer. The outermost company has already begun to fight, and the average soldier is vulnerable to the creamy cake in front of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second row of the left and right wing of the first team on the bayonet! Stepping forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The recruits panicked. The door also grabbed a rifle with a bayonet inserted into the muzzle, stepping forward and standing in the gun. His calm movements and attitudes calmed the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright bayonet is staggered in two rows, waiting in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the action is gone. The captain extended his right hand and signaled the magic officers of the company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use lighting, maximum brightness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling white light appears more in the night Bright, all bayonet reflects the bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin. Wait a minute. This magic doesn't seem to be very strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gusta The husband stared at the ranks of the Free Army and muttered to himself in confusion. Due to the royal lineage, the emperor's vision and judgment on magic are very good. He judged what this magic is, but he did not believe his judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military minister on the side also had doubts. He directly called the two highest court mages to confirm: "Lili Qing! Hobbs Confirm the name of this magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lighting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lighting." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged court painter and the old school magician answered at the same time, without any hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Duke Loren von Figota was lifted up and put down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lighting magic? What do they want to do? Is the 'excellence chapter' deliberately weak? Let's observe it again."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is immediately revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the intensive commando of the infantry array, slowed down in front of the bright bayonet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights screamed loudly, but their horses ran to both sides uncontrollably. The formation of the trial knight was originally like a sharp knife, but now it flows into the gap on both sides like water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right and left wing companies have already retired before, and that is the gap that the door is reserved for them. At the bottom of the gap, it is the reserve team that has just been in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is this? Even the Ordinary Defence Force’s scouting cavalry will not avoid the front of the bayonet array..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gagnel was surprised to see the chaotic enemy battle, could not help but began to doubt what he had learned in school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the door and explain: "But the black horses that are temporarily summoned don't know. They have intelligence, they suddenly see the flash and the sharp edge of the knife, they only subconsciously avoid -"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone picked up his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then rush into the gap and fall into your trap, right, the commander of the Free Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The door that is being blown up is raised, and only the blade of orange light shines in front of his own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl jumped off the horse in the first place and rushed over from the crowd. Just behind the Foreign Secretary, seven or eight soldiers were turning their heads in horror, trying to chase the enemy that had passed through the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Just as they turned their heads, their heads slipped off their necks. The blood column spurted into the sky, and the broken limbs, head and weapons were scattered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "benevolent", the most sharp weapon in the world. While rushing through the crowd, the count has cut off all the "obstacles" on the route, but they still have no feeling. This weapon is not merciful to the onlookers. When everyone sees it for the first time, it will spit out yesterday's dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All spread! Let me deal with him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shouted out the last One command, back two steps, defending the orange sword with the rifle in his hand. The opponent's offensive and skill is so clever, he can barely use the length of the rifle to open the distance and keep his own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that I was put together again by Kewei? Hugh? The Eagle wing launched an attack in anger. The "kindness" in his hands slashed into a piece of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you cut the captain in front of you into hundreds of pieces, you can't cut his anger. Under the leadership of the imperial military minister, the trial of the Knights will actually retreat in front of the bayonet! What will the emperor and military minister behind look at him? How many rumors against him will be passed between the imperial princes in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor and the Duke of Fegota, far behind, are not aware of the ideas of the young foreign minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these two people, the problem is far more serious than this: the other party can actually surround one-half of the Cavaliers! This is definitely not in the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fegotaqing. Do you want to invest in the reserve team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, now is not Opportunity. The opponent has always kept the attacking magic, even the fireball has not been used, it is too dangerous. Only after the cavalry destroys the opponent's front, the followers and priests can safely pass through the central square. Without bullets, if we encounter anti-magic bullets, we will be more vulnerable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke turned his attention to the court mages and pastors, who nodded in agreement . The emperor frowned and made a counter-argument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 'excellence chapter' first used its own bait to guide our cavalry's assault direction, and used the reserve team to surround our main cavalry. In order to rescue the cavalry, It is worthwhile to endure the passage of two or three company squads through the square."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke picked up the telescope and looked forward to the battle. He is too old to see the distant battles directly with the naked eye like young people. Although the Earl of the Eagle Wing and two or three medical knights have already rushed to the "excellence chapter", the formation of the Free Army maintains order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, it’s too risky to invest in a magician. The Guards and the Third and Fourth Army sergeants! Come with me! Royal Guards We must stop your majesty, without my orders, you can't let him attack! The other side has never used any advanced magic, and the rest of the magic is likely to be prepared for your majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Military Affairs, when he was young, claimed that the most powerful knight of the empire had a great appeal in the army. With his order, more than a hundred elite soldiers followed the old duke without hesitation, and braved the bullets to start the charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freezer can only shoot half of the Musketeers. Two or three bullets hit the armor of Loren? von Figota, but they did not even let him slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, the orange light and the purple light were separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the Freedom Array is silent, empty, and only the two radiant hosts stand opposite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a stark contrast to the fierce battles between the two companies, and the punctures of the infantry and cavalry in the reserve team form a sharper contrast. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kewe? Hugh? The Eagle wing stepped back three steps, took the sword back and scabbard, and proudly raised his head. In the circle of five meters around him, no one stood still, leaving only the body and the person who was about to become a dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the opposite "excellence chapter", all people have fallen to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone spurted blood in battle and died, they didn't even have time to see the sparkle of orange light. Several officers, including the Lieutenant Garnier, fled early, and finally escaped their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, your gun can be broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his words The doorknife in the hands of Rene Soleton was broken into seven segments and fell to the ground with powerlessness. The incisions between each segment are exceptionally neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are already a dead person. Touch your neck, a respectable enemy. Use your left hand, because your right hand has also been broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, the expression on the face of the door was froze, and the right hand holding the rifle handle was also frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly raised his left hand and touched his neck. The fingers are moist and there are two levels of blood marks on the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his gaze and looked at the steps in the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenmen? Soledon said in the direction of the steps: "I heard that the owner of 'Benevolence' will leave the last time for the dead. This is They can drive the price of this sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl snorted: "This is the case. If you want to say, then let's talk." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, there are no people around me who can hear my last words." He looked at the steps again. That feeling is very obvious, he can be sure that a girl is staring at him there. "Can you transfer the relics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you better mention a few more names." Earl of the Eagles vented their sense of superiority, wanting to put it before The frustration is washed away. "You will die a lot of people tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want you to pass my guns and last words to Fego Miss Duke of the Tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resist the door with the left hand to the right side of the holster. His movements were particularly difficult because neither the neck nor the right arm could move. He glanced at the opposite step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared at him with a move and moved. He saw her raise her hand to wipe her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have tears for me, 黛妮卡? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Eagle Wing nodded: "I know. It’s a wise choice, the traitor girl of Feng? Figota will probably not die tonight. Is there anything to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this man is too lazy to cover up in front of me. This is also good, because of the door, so that Janica will know his attitude. She will know who is a friend and who is an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried again a few times, and he couldn’t get a gun. He lifted his left hand and placed it on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, you will pull it out at the time. It's not so good, you may not pull it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count turned his head and looked back. Suddenly he stopped him: "Let's wait, the commander of the South Army. As long as you don't push your damn head, you will not die. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Minister of Military Affairs, thank you for your reinforcements. However, I have already solved this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren von Figota swept the door coldly At a glance: "You have already cut off? What is it doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said something very interesting. The commander said he wanted Leave his gun to your young lady." Earl of the Eagle wing made a slight push and proposed his trading conditions. "Do you think this is interesting, Lord Duke?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“boring.” The old duke stepped forward and reached out to Nanimen’s head. “We don’t have time now...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the eagle wing took half of his "kindness." From the position where Gustav and Jenny are in the same position, he can't see his half-drawn sword, only the old Duke of Loren can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke slammed his footsteps: "What do you want to do, Eagle Wing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Nothing. Just, he still has a last word that he wants to hand over to the lady. I think you should listen." The young foreign minister sneered. "Maybe you will want to listen." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, his gaze reunited on the door of the door. Resist the door with his left hand and gently touched the blood marks on his neck, and then looked at it and opened it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My last words are-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Eagle Wing suddenly felt that something was wrong. I don't know when the captain's broken right hand was pressed on the gun. The count remembered that when he used his left hand to touch the gun, the hand was not there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is still going on, but the content of the "last words" seems to be somewhat wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't guess wrong. 'Benevolence' is not a particularly sharp sword; it's just a magic that looks 'very sharp'." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door deliberately nodded hard. "Well, my compound defense magic is effective for it. I am relieved. This is really a good magic, it Satisfy my greatest expectations and some excessive willfulness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, teacher. Excellence chapter plus iron emblem, spell invalid enchantment, trigger dispelling plus multiple physical defenses. This is indeed a near-perfect absolute compound defense magic, and even "kindness" can only leave blood marks in front of it. In theory, absolutely no attack can pass through it during its effective time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I still have the opportunity to submit a magic paper to the association, I can name it 'Zalte Fran's Temporary Invincible'."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of the door was pulled out with a smooth motion, and his thumb and forefinger performed a skilled dance between the trigger and the hammer. He has practiced tens of thousands of times in this movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are spells ineffective enchantment and triggered dispelling magic, he can no longer use the trick of launching six paper-bombs at a time, only using skilled Operate to shoot one shot at a time. As long as this compound defense magic is in effect, he can't use any magic - this is one of the reasons why he pretended to delay the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, his shooting skills are not bad. As a low-end wizard who often consumes light and does not use light magic, Nana often hones his shooting skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six bullets were issued in a very short period of time and flew to the foreign minister without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are delaying the time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the roar of the Earl of the Eagle Wings The door smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lied to me, endurance? Soledon! You lied to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The original count still remembers his name? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his smile immediately solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
