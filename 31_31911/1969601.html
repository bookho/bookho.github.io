			<div id="content">The refreshing evening breeze sweeps away the heat of the day and brings coolness. The young man stood under the east wall of the welfare building and exercised his skills through the last eve of the evening. The black revolver pulsates rhythmically between his holster and his right hand, and it is difficult to see his movements without looking carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his childhood girl, Nika Lopez, lying on her recliner on her back, was leisurely flipping through a borrowed magic book. The turquoise glow surrounds her and illuminates the title page of the book. The invisible servant accepted her order and prepared tea for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems like there is a knock on the door. Go and see, Sorelton?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leiden acted and ended his practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and found that he didn’t know when Nika has disappeared. From her reaction, the juvenile can guess who the person is: the girl in order to practice summoning the magic to stay in every corner of the small welfare home, like countless eyes and ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The uncle is coming again." Soledon sighed with a smile and hurried to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming old wooden door stood outside, and it really was the big man who was dressed up. The serviceman he was carrying was only half as high as the average person. It was the personal sign of the general. Clade Lopez is the father of Seneca, who is also a free army general who supervises thousands of soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s Soledon. Isn’t it still here today?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Er... probably?" Soledon replied in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his expression, the general immediately understood the situation. He patted him on the shoulder and changed the subject: "How recently did your magic grow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton closed the door and took the guests Going in the yard. "Small, the second magic can't be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad sat down on the lounge chair in the courtyard and encouraged: "This is normal. To destroy the mountains. The thieves are very easy, but it is very difficult to destroy the thieves in their hearts. This sentence is said by an oriental philosopher, and his re-disciples told me this. The strength of magic is not important, the important thing is that you Do you know how to use them correctly? I learned this after a lot of dilemmas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general blinked and gestured to his disciples. Soledon immediately understood that the next story was to be told to Renee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was surprised to say: "I have encountered an extremely difficult situation with your level and talent?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. When I first arrived in the East, I was proud of my own arcane level, but I was given a martial art by the Taoist priests. Later I invested in these priests and learned them. The technology, I thought I had learned something, but I didn’t expect to hit another mountain under the mountain. That was really a life of nine deaths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kradton lived from Take a small bag of tea leaves in your pocket. He touched the tin pot on the table and found that the water inside was cold. He smiled slightly, holding the pot handle in his right hand, and the water in the pot immediately boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton is busy with the water and helping the teacher brew the tea: "Can you tell me in detail, teacher?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a long story. It is the seventh year of Dahua's construction. The standard calendar should be 1657." Clad leaned comfortably on the back of the chair. After drinking the tea, I continued. "At that time, I just learned how to go down the mountain, and I made a difference in the Ministry of Rites."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"羁縻What is the ministry?” Soledon asked in a timely manner to help Clade tell the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad explained: "You can understand it as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Seeing that I have a good time in Chinese, the assistant minister asked me to do a hundred in the escort department." "..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The escort division? Hundreds of households?" The teenager carefully spelled these syllables with Chinese that he did not know much, but the pronunciation was still very good. Not standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jianzhi Seven Years/August Dahuajiang North Province Cao'an House<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The river bends and the river is long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riverside is busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food is in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Canal is a symbol of the Eastern Empire. It communicates the granary of the Southern Empire and the capital of the North, as if it were the Empire’s civil service system. The grain and taxes collected in the Jiangnan provinces were concentrated in Nanjing, along the canal to the north, to support the royal princes of the emperor and the 8,000,000 banned army to support the bureaucrats and the people who needed official food throughout the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Klad, why do these Orientals want to make the canal so expensive, corrupt, and slow? From Nanjing to here, the light levels and locks along the way After 13 times, I have transferred five times! Why bother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of Koman’s subordinates makes it difficult for Krad Lopez, the pseudonym Luo Ruide, to answer. He can only helplessly look at the river that is full of awning boats: "Vauban, like you, I don't understand the system of this country. All I know is that we can't move on now." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the perception of the Koman who is called Vauban, the luck is indeed corrupt, expensive, and slow, but it is still the lifeline of the world. Whoever wants to get the world, plundering luck is perhaps the fastest way. When the squad is broken, the banned army in Beijing must choose the way between active attack or passive starvation. If someone wants to rebel, the first priority is to cut off the smuggling, the military guide Jing - this time is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eight hundred miles of urgent reports! King rebellion, has Ezhou! Bingfeng east, meaning Caoan!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team of the escorts of Clade was trapped in Cao Ancheng by this shock. When they arrived at Cao An, the fighting here had been going on for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cao Ancheng is located in the center of the Grand Canal. It is famous for its exquisite porcelain, the largest Qingjiangpu dock on the canal and the fourth largest in the country. On weekdays, the sampan and merchant ships from the south to the north must stop at this gate and stop at the dock. These merchants who have come ashore and Kenting have turned Cao An into a peculiar long strip city. Its urban areas extend to the north and south along the river for dozens of miles. Both sides are shops and shops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cao'an Fucheng is located in the center of the east bank of the river, with a radius of less than ten miles. It is only a small city by the standards of the Hua Dynasty. On the other side of the bank, the rebel camps were flooded, occupying the inns and homes abandoned by the people, and the largest shipyard on the Qingjiang River. They were constantly building ferries. One side of the red-yellow fluttering over the camp, writing the names of different generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The waterway across the river is connected to the village, should it be the striker of the king army?" Looking at the "cheng" banner flying across the river, Klad Silenced to himself, "In terms of wooden camps, this waterway fortress is quite solid, and the leaders seem to be powerful generals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a big deal. It’s big and nothing. In order to accommodate the tens of thousands of people’s fortresses, it’s ten miles, isn’t it waiting to be broken?” The blond Coyman snorted, “If I have a six pound. The artillery can flatten the stockade within three days. If I came to build this camp, even if there were fifteen twelve-pound guns plus thirty engineering mages, it would take half a month."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vauban, I know that you are studying for fortress engineering, but this country does not need such a good fortification technology. Do you have a way to build a fortress that can protect the entire city of Caoan? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vabang stood up and looked at the length of Cao Ancheng. Reluctantly replied: "Yes, but it takes five years and eight million dollars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is it. Maybe Cheng Wangjun is not incompetent. Building a tight camp, but they are not willing to build. In contrast, I value the keeper who can hold this Cao Ancheng." Clad felt a short sigh and smiled. "In my opinion, this Cao Ancheng It is easy to attack and defend. It can defend 30,000 people with 10,000 troops, and it will be more non-general. We should go and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before talking about money, remember our own Oriental name first, Wanqi total! The surname of the Oriental name is in front, it is Luo Baihu!" Klad corrected. "And, Ruide is a word. Orientals Please do not call our name, please keep this in mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High wall, thick wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the city gate, the people panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city gate, officers and soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cao'an Fucheng does have a city wall, but the city wall can only cover the vicinity of Hedong's mansion not too big a few miles. Clade took the team of two hundred escort soldiers and relied on the waist card to reluctantly pass the interrogation of the guards at the gate. The defender will be a guerrilla, and he will let the escort officer station in the station, and bring Crad and Vobang to the house to inform the prefects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two flags on the two sides of the house are very impressive. Klad recognized one of the "rights of Cao Anfu Zhu" and the other side was "the right to participate in Caozhou Junzhou Zhu." His brow furrowed and pulled the officer around him and asked: "Excuse me, are the two adults in this city surnamed Zhu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"罗百户笑笑Now, there is only one Zhu Zhifu Zhu Daren in the city.” Seeing Klad’s face is amazed, the guerrilla added, “The original prefect and the army intend to surrender to the king. After the adults heard the news, they used a seven product. Supervising the body of the imperial censorship, alone with the saints, into the Cao Anjun persuaded several thousand households, and recruited two soldiers to remove the two, and they took the authority to lead Cao'an defense. If there is not Zhu Daren, Cao Ancheng may have fallen ten days ago. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way... This Zhu Zhifu is really a wizard." Clad was attached, and he was worried. Will the person who kills the decision in this way doubt that this unit is a traitor? The guerrilla seemed to see his worries, did not pick up the words, and brought him directly to the prefect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klad entered the lobby of the mansion, the prefects were reviewing the official documents. Somehow, he was surrounded by fully armed guards, and Clade could see at a glance that they were elite soldiers. Surrounded by the snarl of the entire court, only the prefect of the forty-something is surrounded by a soft atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lower official escort division hundred households Luo Ruide, see the prefecture adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Zhu Zhifu When I started, I saw the appearance of the man in front of me. "You are a color person? Can you understand me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next official has been in your country for five years." Clad responded with fluent Mandarin. "The lower official was ordered to escort this year's tribute and rent to Beijing, but he was found to be rebellious by the king. He was trapped here. Hearing that the prefects and adults are defensive, the lower officials feel that they may be useful and willing to serve you. In addition, The deputy of the official, Wan Qi, always came from a great country in the great West. He is also good at artillery. It is also helpful for you to defend the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? I would like to ask Luo Baihu "Where is the teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under the Qingshan Gate." Klad said to transport the flying sword. He didn't dare to use it for too long, just let his "broken dream" float on the right hand side. Several guards saw the handles in a reflective manner and were nervously guarded. Only Zhu Zhifu’s expression was very calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cheng Wang will not make such a stupid thing as a smuggling person. I believe that you are indeed a escort team that can help me hold this city." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence cannot be refused. Clade almost reflexively promised: "The lower official understands."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just said that your people are good at artillery? Unfortunately, Cao Ancheng is small, only Ximen has a copper tire cannon, where the defense will please you. We have been guarding for thirteen days, the crusade is also fast. It’s just like these two days, and it’s like these two days. I hope that your officers and men will take a good rest.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crader promised, bowed Exiting the door, the cold sweat has already oozing out on the forehead. I don't know why, the gentle middle-aged man turned out to be the one who gave him the most pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe this is the so-called 'gentleman'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days Inside, the two armies had their own plots and struggles, and it made Klad fully aware of the war called "East Way." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the day, the Kings Army can burn three riverside outposts, and at night the officers and men will return in the attack camp. During the day, the king army tried to store water and pour the city, and at night the official army could break the dike. Cheng Wangjun concentrated the fleet to cross the canal, and the officers and men burned them with ashes by means of fireboats and cannons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides are changing each other, and the days of decisive battles come earlier than expected. At noon on the fourth day, Cheng Wangjun finally admitted that he could no longer afford to cross the river by boat and bamboo. Looking from the west gate, all the things that used to be ferries are now just a bunch of charred wooden boards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s already like this, should you always die? According to Zhu Daren, the rebel land should have been attacked by the Crusade."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to Klad’s point of view, Zhu Daren just shook his head and shook his head: “No, it’s just getting started. Cheng Wang has secret supporters, and they’re definitely unable to hold it now. I have to go to the table. No matter what happens, I hope that Luo Baihu and Wanqi will always be able to hold the North Gate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhu Zhifu just left, the enemy's gates on the other side of the river suddenly opened at the same time, and countless soldiers rushed out of the array and rushed to the river bank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s really coming. Hell, are these guys who don’t even have a boat going to cross the river?” Vobang said, “It’s not going to Is it swimming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows, Bacheng wants to freeze the river, build bridges with engineering spells, or give the soldiers a water-proof character." Germany casually spoke out the informal river crossing method commonly used in the East and the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tune the gun! Align the river!" Vauban, who is in charge of commanding the artillery, ordered the road. "Even if they dare to freeze the canal, let them go back and forth." Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers of the kings stopped at the riverbank on the west bank of the canal. Many fluttering people walked out of these queues, all of them with long shackles or beards, and a thick yellow headscarf wrapped around their heads. Long and neat snoring sounded from their mouths, covering the entire city of Cao An. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sky is dead, the yellow sky is established, the world is good, the world is good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside the banner of "Cheng", I don't know when there is a bigger banner. There are two incomprehensible ancient characters written on it. Klad can only recognize that it is a script. He still has some impressions on this banner, and he always feels like he has seen it there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change to night, spread beans into soldiers! Sword into the river, call the wind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a moment, the wind seemed to stop, and I did not know where the clouds came from to cover the sun. The robes wrapped in yellow headscarves pulled out the sword and waved in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd finally remembered who they were. "God. Cheng Wang actually colluded with the yellow towel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow towel. This is a heavy name, they have been wandering home for more than a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is definitely not a weak name. The yellow towel that worships "Yellow Heaven" is the state religion of the Murray Empire. The Murray Empire is the largest country on the great route of communication between East and West. On every sailboat of the Murray Empire, the flag of the empire and the flag of the Yellow Knight of the Yellow Warrior are flying. These believers with beards, yellow headscarves and robes were ousted by their home country, but they won the right to pilgrimage to the holy city of Guangzong and Julu in the motherland every year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soldiers are in the array! The water is the land, the yellow sky is the soil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They stretched their swords at the canal. The east wind suddenly blows up, causing the river to stop. The water separates and the river becomes a dry land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land rises upwards, forming a gentle ramp, enough for 30,000 troops to charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go ahead! For our holy place, go forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow scarves are at the forefront They are running faster than running horses. All the sounds between heaven and earth seem to have calmed down, and I can only hear the shouting of the army of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clade rubbed his sweat on his forehead and his fists were close. How to fight this kind of battle? "Impossible...we can't keep it with our strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing those yellow towel warlocks have set foot on the embankment of the east bank... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The list of friends, 汝, etc., know how many people need to dredge this river? 汝 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 可 耗 耗 耗 耗 耗 曰 曰 曰 曰 曰 曰 曰I can't bear it, I can't bear it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Zhu Zhifu suddenly sounded in everyone's ears. His tone was calm, but the voice was very loud, and he even overwhelmed the shouting in the opposite camp. I don't know when, he has already rode a horse, and led the army of seven or eight thousand troops on the east bank of the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"尧舜禹汤,文武周公!孔颜曾孟,荀贾董杨! Zheng Zhou Zhang Shao, Cheng Zhu Lu Wang!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow towel warlocks who have just set foot on the east bank have stopped and listened to the voice of the scribes in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Clade actually felt that he had seen countless white-bearded old Confucians standing behind the Zhu Zhifu. He believes that the yellow towel warlocks have also seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no end to the sacred sacredness! Forgive the students to pass, and today the literary law! The squad will take orders, and I will break the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Cao An Shoujun pulled out their waist knives, and those thick-backed choppers reflected the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is good and no nausea! There are good and bad actions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With The snoring of Zhu Zhifu, the wind blew, the river began to re-start, and it seems that it will start flowing again at any time. Everything seems strange. It seems that there is something hidden behind them. Everything seems normal. It seems that everything should behave this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowing good and knowing evil is a conscience! To be good and evil is a thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers charge It’s that everyone is running faster than the horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven or eight thousand people are like raging waves, swept through the yellow sorcerers, and rushed over the heads of the rebel soldiers! In the blink of an eye, seven or eight thousand people are on the west bank of the river. They are the main force and big camp of the rebels in front of them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Taizhou Xinxue, righteousness like Tao! Seventh day, the bamboo is broken!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conscience That is, Tianli, the heart is righteous. The positive spirit is like the wind, the camp is cracking like bamboo! The canal flowed again and the army struggled to save. The sun is re-casting, and the dark clouds are empty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Yang Ming is under the door of Zhu Zhiyu! Mr. has surrounded Chengyang yesterday, and the clown is not fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hexi Cheng Wangjun’s military heart collapsed. I don’t know which battalion to start with, the king’s army changed, and the soldiers either fled the big flag and fled, or squatted on the ground and begged to surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A good Zhu Zhiyu, a good Yangming door! I did not expect that I have not encountered Shouren, I have been insulted first!" The yellow-skinned warlock shouted, "But do you think this is winning? Do you think that you have kept these Cao Ruan in Cao'an? I don't think about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed hard Lame, shouted: "People listen to orders, peas into soldiers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the yellow sorcerers took their pockets from under the robes and grabbed the beans. Screaming in front of him, meditation in the mouth of the teacher of the great sage. For a moment, an army appeared in the east bank of the river in nowhere, just in front of the west gate of Cao'an! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have the ability to bring your army back, Zhu Zhiyu! The peas quickly attacked the city and won Cao'an!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing the army, Clade felt that all the staff training he had received was in vain. The blood rushed to my mind, and it was anger that was fooled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of army is that? The army that was born out of nothing was evenly rigorous, and it was very different from the army that was summoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green-coloured soldier in a green military uniform stood in front of the battlefield, shoulder-slung rifle, and was responsible for the charge. It was a woody mung bean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-skinned soldier in a black military uniform pressed against the side of the battle, carrying a red knives and carrying the blame, it was a black bean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow-colored soldier in a yellow military uniform guards the two wings of the battlefield, pushing the ladder and rushing to the car, and is responsible for breaking the city. It is a terracotta bean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-skinned soldiers in white uniforms stand in the middle of the battle. They are eight feet taller than ordinary people. It is a golden soy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This large lineup is more than 10,000 people, moving like a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire! Open fire!" Vauban shouted, but he knew his ammunition was not enough. There are so many enemies in front of the Imperial Army or a freelancer. How can he win with these two guns? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a bean sprout! This spell can last for two hours, then we will be finished!” Clad muttered, “I only Can you sprinkle up to eight hundred beans, what should I do...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around me stare at him with hope, which makes Clade sweat Heavy shirt. He is very clear about what they are looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are looking forward to his miracles, or take the initiative to lead them to surrender. For these mercenaries from overseas countries, there is no point in dying here. Seeing that the official army is about to win, how can it fail at this last moment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one can compete with the more than 10,000 beans. Even if Zhu Zhiyu can use the "breaking bamboos" again, I am afraid I can't beat more than 10,000 beans. Unless...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Let's try it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***** ****<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, my self-esteem was seriously damaged by the Orientals. I thought they were not enough to put magic into war, but they didn’t I think that they are to use this as a last resort. In terms of scale, the magical warfare we use on a daily basis is really inadequate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Lopez's past The abrupt end here, the topic suddenly turned into magical art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The spell is called 'Saccharted into a soldier'... Well, I think you can understand it as an activation spell. As long as there is a bean practice medium, the East The mages can summon a fully armed unit from it, and the spell effect can last for a half-day. In the Eastern Dao, this is already a very advanced skill, one or two of the ten people will be fine. A qualified Taoist priests can sprinkle up to a hundred soldiers, and no one usually relies on this magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that magic like...?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about what this magic is! How did you defeat the rebels in the end, Klad?" I can't hear the ending of the story, Jenica Finally could not help, pushed open the door of his room. "What magic did you use to defeat the tens of thousands of summoned creatures?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that.
