Today There are things on the agenda."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was woken up by the sound of a crisp, sweet, and unfeeling voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning sun shines through the gauze and shines on the face of the young man. He stumbled over his body, subconsciously wiped the sweat from his head, and opened his eyes very reluctantly toward the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abominable, and relived Rennie’s memory in his dreams, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that dream, there is a bloody smell that can never be forgotten, and there is a girl who still has one arm still fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he doesn't think this is a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was not seen in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rubbing his eyes, he stood up and walked to the window against the sun. The light pierced his drowsiness and made him feel as if he was going to melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking out from the window of his bedroom, you can see the symbol of the phase port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cross-section of the Shuimen Strait's phase bridge reflected the golden-green light in the morning sun, and directed straight into his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a red flag representing the Republic of Intres and a large heraldic flag dragging it under the window, symbolizing the new luxury elf building the host. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the southern countries were independent from the sacred Coman Empire, the position of the coat of arms officials not only did not disappear, but the business volume did not fall against the age of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only the coat of arms that nobles and royal charters could have. Now every member, business, officer, company wants to customize. As long as they are heraldic, they will hang out whenever they have the chance, and the independent gendarmerie is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shield-shaped coat of arms on the flags symbolizes the "Intresal Army of the Republic of England", "The Chief Staff of the Intres", and "All Freedom in the Narrow Sea" The military judge of the army" and "the temporary governor of the phase port." Each coat of arms is divided into four quadrants, each with its own holder of the title holder, depicting the holder's personal coat of arms - its structure is like the little millet on the flags of certain countries in a certain world. Word flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the red-red star that spreads on the sky blue background, like the quadrant of the blood drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This large string of coats represents the city’s nominal ruler, Major Neremon Soledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fierce battle in the phase port, the military government’s aftermath command quickly reached the city. The parliament became a guardian council, and the mayors and parliamentarians, who were inextricably linked to the rebel giants and Elf Oriental, were dismissed, and the independent gendarmes were in military control of the phase port before the local elections were re-established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new appointment, there is a pile of orders, and the returning is a vast request, and then the magic is coming again. Approval. The Conti Fox dictator gave him almost all the necessary authorizations: forming a national army, collecting taxes, auditing the state treasury and the city treasury, promoting the aides, executing the criminals, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s time for breakfast. You better not be late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen The memory reminded him of the voice of his dream girl, and the doorman couldn’t smile anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young major replied casually and put on his best red military dress. He hesitated, and as usual he tied the "dark" one-shoulder military uniform behind the cloak and walked out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The checkpoint on the corridor removed the two groups, and no longer the official Free Army soldiers took on the duties of guards. Most of the veterans in the gendarmerie have been sent out to suppress illegal law, recruit soldiers, and take over administrative work. Instead, they are recruits who have just recruited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of these recruits are women, and most of them are blond, which seems to strongly prove the rumors in the market. The young blond girls wore unsuitable military uniforms, some unnaturally touched the pistols, and guarded the corridors under the guidance of female sergeants who were not old enough. Many people read the papers in a low voice with scroll papers. I don’t know how to read literacy, I’m learning magic in the word, I’m going to learn the magic of connecting magic nets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir." "Lord of the Chief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance to the door, return to the ceremony, in officers and soldiers They went down the stairs in salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downstairs is the main restaurant of the Independent Gendarmerie Command, responsible for feeding more than a thousand officers and men living around this complex. When it was the restaurant of the Elven Minister, it was used as a venue for the state banquet. There was a scary grand banquet table. It was said that the Emperor Kleon of the Old Elf Empire had banqueted more than one hundred of the half-homes on it. Famous guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Unfortunately, Nanimen only had a breakfast next to this antique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the door of the restaurant, and the soldiers inside were taking food from the banquet table that was the buffet table. In the main space of the restaurant, there is a small dining table that is originally used for servants to eat. These dining tables and simple wooden chairs are arranged like a square queue, and at least eight people can be seated around each table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Free Army regulations, it is not necessary to conduct military ceremonies when eating, but people still spontaneously pay attention to them and their chiefs...and then people will Looked at the corner of the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the past few days, three young women were sitting in the corner of an ordinary table, only one seat was reserved. The major took a deep breath and smelled the food aroma in the cafeteria and sat down at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--They are the reasons why Jean-Nin’s took the big dining table to the corner of the canteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Early, the door." Metty Crosso's greetings are as refreshing as her blond short hair, no guest, like a brother or sister or a long-time friend The greetings between the nature are so natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Mr. Soledon." The first princess of the empire, Reeve Namlock, Olia Hugh Coleman is calm and elegant. The land told him good morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really early, the warlord makes you?” The strength of the number one in the port of Hong Kong sent a greeting to Zhang Houyi with a three-point teasing. The unique swaying, with the tail of the rising tone is soft, just like the teasing between lovers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three beautiful women almost greeted him at the same time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--the slightest look Not to mention, a few days ago, their men performed almost in this restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first day of moving in, the chef team led by the manager of Zhang Shiyi’s fan-wool towel brought six boxes of shiny, green-headed roast ducks. Metty brought an Intrepid chef of the same size and tit-for-tat, equipped with three full buckets of squid. The first princess of the Empire was the smallest, but the most luxurious, consisting of a plenipotentiary ambassador and three imperial chefs. In order to seat and the kind of dishes, the three followers almost hit each other. The final result of the negotiation was that Naimen had to eat a breakfast equivalent to three times the amount of lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final solution was also provided by Anne’s memory: the entire restaurant was urgently converted into a style called “buffet”, provided by the logistics department. The materials allow all the cooks to cook the whole command to feed the entire headquarters, and the officers and men are free to use their own food. These foods have also greatly improved morale, but also solved part of the troubles of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the trouble of having to eat with three ladies for breakfast has not been solved. In particular, they don’t look right today. Before the end of the door is pretending not to see, but after sitting, it can not be pretended not to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Zhang Shiyi's honey-colored single-tailed tail has become a lot lighter, and it can be seen as a wig. As for Princess Olia, the long straight hair of the black waist turned into a golden yellow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and looked at each other’s hair, and their faces flashed a blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s not for you to dye hair... It’s strange." Zhang Shiyi dialed the pony tail. "How about this golden? If you don't like it, I can change a few more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia’s answer is simple and straightforward: "I saw this kind of magic in the magic net, I tried it. I hope you will like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bitter smile floated on the corner of the door, he did not know what to do. Instead, Metty put down the fork and looked at the neighbors on both sides of the left and right, only to realize the high-figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that both of you suddenly got blond hair and felt that you liked the door. He likes blonde hair? No. He is looking for a young girl with blond hair. It was because of his former adjutant Miss Sefer, a blonde beauty. She lost contact in the battle of Lenny, and her whereabouts are unknown..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I opened my mouth and wanted to stop Metty, but I found out that I didn't know how to stop it. He didn't want to listen anymore, grabbed the bread and wanted to walk away from the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several women have discovered the change in his face. Zhang Shiyi wanted to reach out and grab his cloak, but his hand stopped in midair; Olia stood up halfway and grabbed his left hand directly; Metty stopped him with some mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, Ninmen, can't I say these words? Miss Saffer's disappearance, isn't everyone in the gendarmerie know?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." The door gently and steadily pulled his hand out. "Please continue, I just have an urgent military service." I don't want to listen to my own things again, rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly left the restaurant and walked down the stairs, pretending not to feel behind his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance knows that Metty’s statement of this matter will not harm his image – at least better than “a good-looking officer who loves blondes” Much more. I am afraid, in the view of Olivia or Zhang Shiyi, Anne Sefer is just a dead competitor - perhaps not even a competitor. This kind of feeling usually earns a few tears and some extra points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessing does not want to accept such sympathy. I don't want to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes, no, he knows that Anne is still alive. He will find her and restore her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, he didn't want to be sympathized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor was occupied by the Independent Gendarmerie Staff. The staff who have already finished their breakfast are busy around the vast sand table of the Republic of Intres, and those who have no jobs are fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet of chess pieces and troop pieces on the sand table are in groups of three, like a set of diplomatic games set in a specific area. In a few days, of course, I couldn’t make such a fine sand table. This big sand table was also accidentally captured in the Elf Embassy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when he actually stood in front of the sand table, he felt a little bit more about the dangers of the previous situation. Naimen is not a staff officer from the class, even the military chess and diplomatic games are only occasionally played - that is, Clade Lopez stayed in the welfare home, and now I am afraid it will be burnt into a group of ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder they have to give it a go. If it weren’t for the power of the Seventh Fleet, the city, and even the entire Interry, had changed hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green sails on behalf of Saint-Sen are filled with the surroundings of the Interlaken Sea, and the gray army pieces of the Empire are placed in various ports. When the entire power of the free nations fell on the battlefields of Jena and Blenheim, the expeditionary forces of the Sanctuary and the Empire had occupied seven or eight coastal areas. As long as the phase port is taken again, the territory of Interlake Bay and the narrow sea will be united, and the Republic of Intres will only be able to stand in the inland counties of the two islands without any threat at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the elves of the Far Sea Fleet Commander Drey Wayne Mandrill "Intres" was born in four families and was defeated. After the Fifth Fleet, it was already the big man in the Elven Navy sequence, second only to the Commander-in-Chief of the Two Seas Fleet, General Churchill. If this goal is reached again, he will become the most successful Sansen general since the collapse of the Elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ceasefire of the Army, the battlefield of the three parties was transferred to the sea. Starting from the port of the port and the capital of the Republic of France, Pylo, the arrow representing the counterattack plan fills the narrow sea, not only pointing to all the lost land occupied by the Imperial Expeditionary Force, but also all the trade owned by the Elf and the Sanson Oriental Company. Stations, ports and leaseholds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the prestigious name of "Intres", the Freedoms of the State have already freed up their hands. It seems that it is time for the elves to pay the price. Those ports and merchant fleets look like a fragile egg, completely exposed to the iron fists of the Free Army and the Navy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The battle will probably erupt when the elves gather a large enough merchant fleet to forcibly break through?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After standing in front of this sand table for five minutes, this high-spirited passion improved the resistance of the door is not too good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, sorry to let us know, we have to update the regular contact." A staff member squeezed past him. "There was a message from the Flemish fleet. They have joined the Seventh Fleet three-point fleet and will enter Hong Kong this morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Faeus Small Fleet?" Resist the subconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, due to the bon voyage, they are expected to arrive in Hong Kong this afternoon instead of the afternoon. The staff is updating the schedule," the staff member pulled out of the pocket watch, " The welcome ceremony will be held in advance and may be merged with the exchange’s first transaction.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance to recall today’s schedule from memory, recall The incident mentioned by the staff. Every day in the phase port, he is like a war. Although he has been fighting before, he does not have so many daily affairs. As the hero of the fifth free war and the temporary governor of the phase port, his appearance is worth a few discounts on war bonds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome ceremony...ah, yes. My reinforcements, and the lady is coming."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff member was slightly surprised: "It is impolite to mention the venerable Archbishop, sir. I heard that some French monks are very fanatical. Your Excellency can come to the Port of Hong Kong and it will be of great help to our local operations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, thank you, less. I will pay attention. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this mouth, the door is not serious. The journey of the chief innovator, Bonnie Seifer, was made in his bedroom, and the journey was to get the opportunity to requisition the power of the Intercontinental Reconstruction. He turned his head and began to ask another group of guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what about our follow-up reinforcements? After a few weeks, we should be able to draw people from the lesser-damaged Italian and French troops. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are on the fleet of the Seventh Fleet. However, the number is small and will not exceed 500."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that's all an officer. It's enough to set up the shelves of the two divisions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A freelancer needs five or six There are hundreds of officers at all levels, and a national guard also needs two or three hundred people. This is good news, and I think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general who wants to lead the team will not be too difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not care about surrendering power But he also did not want the independent gendarme, a team composed of the hardest soldiers in the Free Army to be bullied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelmen picked up the red pawn representing the Freedom Army and placed it in the position of the phase port. After that, he left the hall and went to the port to check the preparations there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people are busy, time will pass It is very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking all the preparations, confirming the situation and progress with the subordinates and collaborators of different departments, Nexen found that he was already in the front of the phase port. The character - of course, including the Warlord, surrounded his subordinates and his companions in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what does time have to do with White Horse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem seems to be stumped by Anne's memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the memory was busy searching, Nanimen stood on the pier of Westport and looked at the shadow of the sky in the harbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salute of the ear was ringing back, and the huge and bulky four-ship transport ship slowly leaned onto the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd gathered in a timely manner. People who come here, in addition to the intimidating agents, are basically ordinary people who hold an expectation for the Free Army. Anything that enhances the power of the Free Army will enhance their confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door turned his head and waved at the crowd, and a burst of cheers broke out in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at it! That is to defeat the imperial emperor's 'Lonnie's hero!'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Long live the Free Army and the Navy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the new owner of the phase port... really young. The appearance is very confusing, really can't see It’s a guy who has been quietly busy collecting beautiful women and being ridiculous for two days.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, such whispers, the door is inaudible . Even the deafening cheers, he did not listen to how much. All the attention of the young majors is concentrated on the ramps in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that came down the gangway was a gray-haired middle-aged man who was quite familiar with him, and a slightly blessed middle-aged man. Admiral Navy. The SS Marshal of the Seventh Fleet personally led the main fleet to chase the main force of the St. Sens of Intreus, and handed the rear to the General Fisher, who was responsible for the operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few days have not seen, the battle is not small." Lieutenant General Fisher said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was modestly succinct: "The power is maintained. It has been very difficult to get the port back to normal operation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that everything can be done according to our agreement. Is the specific manager?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bank thing is Crowe Suojia. The property of the auction company is complicated. I temporarily handed it over to Zhang and three other local families to use their talents. If you have a need, you can negotiate with them directly. If there is any need for the Seventh Fleet. Ships, supplies or land can be prioritized in your share."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will not bother your army's business."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the Admiral’s lieutenant, there is a black goatee with two goatee beards. It looks like a forty-five-six-year-old black-haired translucent monocle. gentleman. He wore a green military uniform from the French army, a star on his shoulder, and a matching silver cross. It is a major general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was smiling, and the first and foremost, the quick military ceremony expressed goodness and did not leave the problem to the other party. The contrasting expression on the opposite side was obviously relaxed, and I returned to a similarly firm return. While the hands of the two sides were tight together, they exchanged their identities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Temporary Governor of the Phase Port, the Intrepid Superintendent, Major N. Soleton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The former Chief of Staff of the Third Freedom Division, the current 14th Freedom Division 'Zhuhai' Commander, Dubrid Gaohao (dupleixgodehau). I am also a long-awaited name, the young Governor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're welcome, call me the major, you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom before the war There are a total of twelve divisions, and the remaining three republics are now trying to expand their troops while making up their shortfalls. The code name of the thirteenth freelancer is "miracle", which is the unit that Bonnie Sefer has recruited and formed as a superintendent of the Fadis. The 14th Freelancer, who is responsible for the recruitment of the goalkeeper, is ranked behind it. The military and political council decided to name it "Zhuhai Division" (14thffdivision"ove<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seas"). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier with pale yellow curls wore the sub-tropical military uniform of the Italian-American runner-up. It looks younger than the younger brother, and looks like he is in his thirties. He has a special glove in his right hand, only three fingers, the index finger and the middle finger are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reconstruction of the Ninth National Division 'Dragon Gun' Commander, former ninth 'Fist Blade' National Division, Colonel Schrope Cliff ( Sh<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opclive)."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, the sword of the boxer? We are Lenny had seen one side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original ninth national The guard's "fist" was completely annihilated in the Lenny guarding battle, and only Lieutenant Colonel Cliff retained half of the established camp. The only surviving head of the Lieutenant Colonel was promoted as a fighting hero and came to rebuild this all-out force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rebuilding, the division’s symbolic weapon has changed from the shortest attacking edge to a full-length gun that is more than seven meters long – the Ninth National Guard Dragon Gun" (9thmf<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;division"d<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agonlance"). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two senior officers led the new military corps from Fort Worth and Faws, and both of them had representatives on their chests. The small medal of the temporary title. The number of military officers in this reinforcement is less than half of the number, and the rank and curriculum vitae are lower than they should be - no matter which senior free division has no senior officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the onlookers are not aware of this. What they can see is the silver star on the shoulders of this army and the honours on their chests, as well as the full set of equipment that shines with various magical lights. This time the reinforcements even brought an oversized cavalry company, and the tall northern horses and the mixed-race celestial horses were equally impressive. People sighed at the high ranks of these reinforcements, the excellent equipment, and the looming feeling that the recovery of the narrow sea is just around the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two parties exchanged their own situation, they quickly handed over the specific work to the staff officers below. The staff of the 14th and 9th National Divisions of the future just got off the boat and rushed to the gendarmerie headquarters with the exhaustion of the journey to receive the supplies and barracks of the troops, leaving the generals to continue to operate importantly on the dock. Boring ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything seems to be going well, and the remaining half of the officers and troops are also dependent on the work of the major. In my teacher, How much space is left for the honorary officer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, my division officer is up to two-thirds of the .........or, the dragon shooter is The demand for money is even greater."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honorary officers are the common fundraising methods of the Free Army. Many members took off their formal attire and put on the uniforms of the colonel or major, led a regiment, a battalion of troops, and paid for conscription and logistics; there were also many important sponsors who chose the name of the staff or the magic officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't plan to recruit honorary officers or militia on a large scale, which may affect the combat effectiveness of the troops." Nike shook his head. "My plan is, first Each group formed a group as the core force of the two divisions, used to crusade the emperors and liberate the counties of the coastal areas. The fundraising plan will begin today. If the two spirits are still good, I ask the two to assist here. Our work has increased the confidence of those donors and bond buyers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of these topics, all three people are laughing. From the time he saw the battle against the door, Gao Huo and Cliff knew his intentions. As officers of the free nations, they cannot be fully engaged in combat and training like the empire's counterparts. It is also an important part of the work to obtain military expenses from the local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fundraising? Willing to serve. Of course, today's protagonist should not be us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guest who is better at us than this, we should also rely on Hong Kong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Cliff pointed to the sea. The second round of salutes gradually rang, and the crowd was excited again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner behind the crowd, a few low-key girls are whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I learned a little while mixing the sailors at the dock. The slogan means..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former thief union female cadre who made the name of Bai Ruisi squinted Looking at the second boat slowly approaching the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the stupid and heavy merchant ship of the Transport Corps, this is a warship, or a three-story deck full of spinnakers And a fast main ship with many magic cannons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short bow of the main mast to the rear mast hangs a short tribute to the tribute, but there are other hangs in the main semaphore area from the bow to the main mast. Message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former thieves’ union’s “skin” Di Meiyi did not know the words, but she knew the letters and phrases represented by each banner and put the letters represented by each banner. I copied it on the notebook of Bai Ruisi, whose code name is "White Silk". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Ruisi put these letters together one by one, read the corresponding words, and tell them to the two companions around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It means, on behalf of the venerable gods, to pay tribute to the Seventh Fleet and Phase Harbor -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one person in the southern countries who can use the religion of the "respectable gods and spokespersons". The flag of the Golden Holy Emblem, which is flying on the bow, is also showing the identity of the owner of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All salutes are welcoming! Welcome to the Archbishop of all churches, Lord Bonnie Sefer, to the Phase Port Innovation Conference!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ruling bishop of the Phase Port Innovation Association rushed past the officers of Naimen, rushing to the end of the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a month ago, his church was still an important branch of the Park. Now, the original four major new faculties have acknowledged their factual status under Bonnie Sefer, the greatest theologian of the world. The innovation will be above the agreement, the law, the repair, and the four introspection. On the first church. As long as the problem of the highest level of magic is solved, the name is not important at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last round of salute emptied all the shore guns, and the entire fleet in the port also fired. After all the guns were released, suddenly the entire dock suddenly held their breath, leaving only the sound of the sea breeze in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence of this unexpected encounter, the figure of Archbishop Bonnie Sefer wearing a pure white tulle dress appeared in Bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s pace can’t be said to be awesome, her posture is not very special; but everyone feels that she is firmly in herself On the road. Her translucent ice-blue crystal high heels stepped on the pedals, leaving a projection without a slight offset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like a holy and inaccessible flower of Gaoling, which can make people feel a kind of religious peace and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is almost impossible to associate her with the girl she once knew. The Bonnie Sefer, who he knows, is calm and wise and decisive, sometimes inaccessible, but also a beautiful person who can communicate and occasionally laugh. Today's Bonnie, it looks like...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like the word 'The Archbishop of the Virgin' becomes a real person."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said to himself in a voice that no one can hear. The kind of firmness, serenity and ability to break through everything, he seems to have seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie stopped in front of the bishop and looked at him with a frosty look. The bishop only slightly hesitated, and then his right foot was withdrawn, ready to kneel to her; but Bonnie’s right hand thundered out, blocking the further movement of the bishop’s adult and saying that since the disembarkation the first word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to salute me. I came to Interlaken to bring blessings to everyone, not to walk in favor. Let us build better together." The church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mouth was finally thawed, and a smile appeared. At that moment, Nanimen seemed to see Anne's shadow in her smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone flashed a golden light in front of their eyes, and then they felt something in their minds sweeping past and swept away the exhaustion of the whole body. If you want to describe it, it is like the refreshing feeling when you wake up and get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a high-level magic. In fact, almost every priest and priest who is somewhat identifiable will use this magical skill carefully to facilitate the popularization of doctrine and to strengthen people's beliefs. But it is easy to use blessings for tens of thousands of people like this, but there is no doubt that it is the proof of the top theft users. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrast between the "Frost of the Virgin" and the blessing of the smile, easily erased the last heart of the hearts of the people of Hong Kong. No one goes to the age and gender of Yi Bonni, and no longer has any doubts about a distant saint; the crowd is filled with sudden bursts of fanaticism, and the waves sweep from them, and the cheers can be awkward. Turn the entire Westport. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long live the saint!" "She is a good pastor." "I feel she can really build a better church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people cheered and exchanged their views, and the scene was very lively. There are only a few who have doubts about Protestantism, and those who have known Bonnie Sefer before can remain calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orthodox ambassador of the Orthodox Church in the Port of Hong Kong, Ionite Hartman frowned at the inconspicuous, whispering to the side of the Olympics Leah said: "She is the Bonnie Seifer that you have met before? It is really threatening. It is really not feasible to be a Orthodox church here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. She is indeed a very, very dangerous opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess Olia said, looking to the front not far away The resistance of the door. After listening to Metty's story of the door, she quietly changed her hair back to the black hair of the imperial royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she turned her gaze to Zhang Shiyi and Metty, who stood behind the door: Metty looked overly excited, and Zhang Shiyi’s left fist was tight. Holding it tightly, just like she is ready to fight at any time - it is interesting that she still retains the blonde with her skin color and body shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I am not nervous, the princess of the empire is smiling in my heart. Bonnie Seifer is one of those who can put tremendous pressure on people even if they don't do anything. As early as she was only a district of "Pluto Luther", the security department of the empire was already carrying the name all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I prepared a countermeasure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she saw Bonnie Sey Phil walked quickly across the landing stage and walked in their direction. She exchanged a look with Nana, and the young acting governor left the crowd and walked to her side. Another bridge that was negotiated in advance, Olia thought a little dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally saw you, my hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie reached out with kindness Come and drop a shocking statement. Her voice is clear and loud, and there is no misunderstanding. Almost all of those who could hear this sentence were in horror, including Nami Soleton himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She just said 'My hero' is right? What does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey. Quiet. We may be witnessing an amazing scene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is screaming in the heart, "You should talk to me first about the script." Hesitant about how to act. It seems as if I should go up and shake hands, but the shocking sentence made him have to take some unexpected actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young major holds up the other’s right hand and sighs: “If this is the will of the gods, I am willing to be the hero of Miss Sefer.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squatted on his knees, bowed his head, and kissed the back of Bonnie Seifer’s right hand. He is talking about Seifer, not Bonnie. He vowed to be the hero of Anne Seifer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of the saint is not as close to her expression and expression. Her palm was warm, and after his sudden kiss, his fingertips were still trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why I came to the phase port is because I saw the future in the magic of prophecy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie took his hand back and lightly In the light area, the door was able to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future I see, we will inherit all the resources of the Elven colonial cause."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Archbishop’s teachings are concise and straightforward. Bonnie Seifer's voice is peaceful and full of conviction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future I see, our colonies will replace their trading posts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She is convinced that the undoubted gaze sweeps through the crowd, as if to see a solid future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future I see, our chartered company will replace their charter company."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like she has seen it with her own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future I see, we can not only be the transporters at sea, but we can also become the masters of this sea."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the crowd began to get hot. Prophecy claims to be one of the most powerful, but also the most problematic, schools of all magical schools. The accuracy of the vast majority of prophetic magic is within a suspicious range, perhaps as a tool for the Imperial Budget Department and insurance companies to predict the future, but will never be made public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future I have seen, the phase port will rule this route and become the new home port of the free nations."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, an archbishop has publicly stated the prophecy. If this prophecy cannot be realized, it is even hard for people to imagine how the entire sect will be hit hard--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, this prophecy cannot be wrong. The archbishop of the Freedoms, the Archbishop Bonnie Sefer, will mobilize all her power to ensure that this prophecy is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future I see, my hero will bring me a gift of his sacred emblem to create this."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie quietly took off the holy emblem on her chest. It is a sacred emblem with a transparent giant diamond and a few large diamonds. Whether it is raw material or the above-mentioned ornamentation, it looks very luxurious. Only the largest and most top-level church has the money and ability to manufacture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I came here to make this prediction a reality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Pico Looking up, I took care of the neckline. The military dress he wore and the collar of the worn-out one-sleeved uniform worn behind him were mixed and messy. It was very sloppy, and Bonnie helped him to level it up, and then put the one's own emblem seriously. The chest of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slightly relative and cross-border movement is seen in the crowd as a formal guarantee for the end of the rule of Nylon Soledon, but for the other For women, it is tantamount to a blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like an unmarried couple..." Ionet Hartman said in the lowest voice, a pretty smile on the beautiful face, hope To the deputy around him, "The surprise you prepared, is it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he will say something in the scorpion. The patriarch's envoy found that the first princess of Olia Hugh Coleman's fingers had been pressed to the ear and was communicating through communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it late?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionette hurriedly looked up. He was the first of all to look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, Bonnie, who had worn the emblem of the door and arranged the grooming, also raised his head. This action has no omen, and the door that is close at hand is also subconsciously leaning back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd followed her and looked up -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the silver glow The dragon rushes down from the clouds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
