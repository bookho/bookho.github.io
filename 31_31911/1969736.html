She did not deliberately use the constant purification to purify the poisonous air like Ionite, but the air seemed to be unable to pass the magical technique of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fell on the muddy ground with the inner wall of the room, not far from a huge black building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a building without color, no windows, or even a structure, like a post-modern building with a stone-free office building without windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Ionette Hartman, this is a different world full of poisonous gas; but for Bonnie, it is not a different place here. world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw the building, she knew the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Palenha..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land covered by a yellow curse The old capital of the Marquis of Palenia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A place name that disappeared into history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history that everyone knows is that the old capital of Palenia is a dead city destroyed by the war, just like the empire of the Eastern Empire. The ancient big city that the river floods engulfed was general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 13th century, during the split of the Holy See, the Marquis of Palenia, then the Minister of Royal Security, stood on the side of the Pope’s support of the Emperor DeLand and gathered near the territory. Heavy soldiers intend to attack the Holy See who control the Holy Land. The challenged Pope Taranto led the attack on Palenhaho, and the two sides secretly made the secret, and eventually the Pope of Taranto failed to leave the area, and the city of Palenia and its rulers were also on the map. Disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the land that was not affected by the war, forty miles away from the old city ruins, the emperor established the new Palenni for the heirs of the Marquis of Palenia. Yacheng is now a famous city that can enter the top ten of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is also a saying that the old Palenia, which was cursed by the Pope and deported to a different world, still exists until the summoning of magic and the plane of the plane is taken from this world. Until isolated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this legendary city stands in front of her eyes, proving the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will anyone come to welcome me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie bowed his head and saw Look at your boots and walk in the mud to the building. She didn't see any decent roads, presumably here was probably the garden behind the postmodern castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mud pool under her feet is full of venom and odor, she seems to be walking on a paved red carpet, no matter whether it is boots or calves. Dip a trace of mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, Bonnie has not publicly used even a single magical technique, and has overcome this malicious and cursing by relying on the magical props and blessings she holds. surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that someone is watching her. Even if it is old Palenia, it certainly will not always meet such powerful and dangerous visitors as the Archbishop of Innovation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But always went to the door, there was no ambassador or a meteor. Bonnie reached out and pushed the door open into the back door of this postmodern building. The door is a small hall, and the gas seems to fade a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical array is not even hidden, but it is a dangerous red light, just like giving her a horse. If it is a general intruder, I am afraid that I am now scared to start preparing for defensive magic - but Bonnie, who has built more than one fortress without any help, has no eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just gently pushed a small step to the side to see the effect of this magic array. Looking closely, she narrowed her eyes: the effect of this magical array was really beyond her expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is this room actually an airlock? Has this invented the airlock?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As the magic array moves, the air in the room begins to be purified. Not efficient, but it effectively isolates the cursed gas from the outside. Bonnie also immediately understood why this building would look so modern, without windows, without color, and without structure - that is to ensure that the curse's poison gas does not penetrate through the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this re-purifying air is definitely not good, with a rotten and musty smell for two or three hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie took a deep breath of the air, which was non-toxic, but with a musty smell, shouted openly:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sid Nass!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound echoed in this airlock room. The air gradually purified, but the opposite door did not show any signs of opening, and no one responded to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie’s eyebrows have a little wrinkle that represents impatience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The holder of the death knell, the immortal, the security minister, Sid Naser! It took so much effort to bring me over, this is your waiting The way to the guest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still no response, but the opposite sealed door quietly opened. A man dressed in a gray robes, like a medieval monk dressed in the door, appeared at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President guests, please come with me. There are many in the building that are used as part of the training ground and prison, although it is certainly not difficult to live with you, but if it is damaged It’s also very troublesome to fix it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s really cumbersome to build such a building in such a place.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie tried to talk, but the intention of not responding to the opposite side was just to lead the way. The interior of the building is not postmodern, it is a typical medieval castle: the structure and support are chaotic, the rooms and walls are numerous, all around the corners and corridors, like a maze. Due to the unreasonable structure design of the Middle Ages, from time to time you can see the heavy-duty pillars that have been reinforced with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil lamp and the magic lamp are alternately illuminated, and some places deliberately have no illumination, leaving a darkness. The passer-by walks through the maze, sometimes opening the door normally with a key, sometimes pushing a wall that looks out of the surface without any anomalies, revealing a secret passage behind it or a narrow upward stair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After climbing up the stairs three times, Bonnie finally saw an office in which two of the same gray robes were worn, such as a monk. people. One of them stood up and whispered a few words with the guide, becoming a new guide. The guide at the beginning turned away from the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, let me lead the way for distinguished guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the second person The attitude, even the movements are very similar to the first passers-by, the pace is strong, the fingers are slightly bent, showing that they have received similar rigorous training. Bonnie speculated that he would probably not talk to her, and simply began to use the speed algorithm to figure out how many similar people in the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Assuming a room can accommodate two to three people, this complex structure can accommodate up to twenty similar rooms on the first floor. The first two layers look There is probably no office area in the structure. Is it that the big castle is estimated to be used by up to three or four hundred people? No wonder it has been so long and no one else has met..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Up three layers, down one level, then up two layers, then down one level. Bonnie speculated that this place is not eight or nine. Can be seen around the complex protection and anti-detection magic luxury deployment, and occasionally see the transmission anchor. When I was close to the top, I changed my third passerby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie recalled in her mind the ancient buildings she had visited, as opposed to the building that was stubbornly rooted in the curse. The closer to the top, the simpler the structure of the building, the more the load-bearing walls and pillars, but the surrounding protective magic and detection magic become stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After climbing three hidden circular staircases, the guide led her to a wide corridor. The corridor is covered with a red carpet, and the roof is raised to see the roof. The roof has a skylight that communicates with the outside world. The natural light is lightly cast, which is in stark contrast to the moldy floors on the underlying layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, no wonder you have to fix this building so high. The curse is surrounded by the land, so if you fix it high enough, you can exchange air with the outside world. Right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie suddenly realized. The guide did not answer her feelings, slightly bowed, pointing to the carved golden gate at the end of the corridor. The door unexpectedly, there is no sense of magic; and the ceiling of the window can read at least four different colors of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy of Sid Nass, let me go around such a big circle, wouldn’t it be time to get a shower and change clothes?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie had an ankle that felt sour because she climbed too many stairs, strode to the door, pushed it open, and threw herself at the owner. complain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The welcoming ceremony of the Royal Security Department headquarters is really lengthy. Anyway, it is necessary to use the magic to pull people in. Can't you send me directly here? There isn’t even a chat on the road, it’s very boring.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room is not big, can’t tell if it’s a bedroom, a palace or an office, there is a bed, there is a office The table, but behind the desk is a luxurious silk chair, and there is even a dining table next to the fireplace. All furnishings are typical of the court style, with luxurious frames and gold and red as the main color, which is not surprising at all - but from another perspective, it is possible to maintain such a room in a waste city that has been expelled from the main world. It was originally something that was unexpected enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is most unexpected to her, is the owner of this room. It wasn't a gloomy Sid Naser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hate that people are smudging this room. Here, in order to prevent the poison gas from being isolated from the outside world, it is very troublesome to pack up, so the delivery points of the foreign guests are set. It doesn't matter if it's dirty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the room is an elegant woman who can’t see the age, saying that it’s twenty years old, it’s forty. It is also possible that the hair is slightly shiny silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t sit in the gorgeous chair, but stood at the table, facing a square wooden carved chessboard, studying the black and white The chess pieces constitute the situation. Even if the door was opened and the visitor came in, she could not attract her attention from the board. Bonnie could only see her side. Probably studying the chessboard, she wears glasses, not the monocles that are commonly used by jewelers and alchemists of this era, but two pairs of gold-rimmed glasses that are closer to the later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first impression her side gave to Bonnie was that it was a very dangerous woman. Whether it is the eyes or the five senses, they all have a sharp and extraordinary feeling. A pair of glasses can't block her sharpness. This heroic and sharp gas almost makes people forget that she is also a beautiful and extraordinary woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I asked the current security minister to go to the chess player who wanted to play against us. I didn't expect him to make it. I invited you all over. I was originally here." I think the opposite player will be a man, a politician, and perhaps a soldier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Royal Security Department building in a different world, the woman who gave orders. Bonnie quickly searched for memories in her mind, and a possibility emerged. Very absurd possibility, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She decided to ask this question positively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To each other, I thought I would meet a man here. Of course you are not Sid Naser, but you have the Royal Security Department... Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you are here, I naturally don't mind letting you know this secret. Even in the court of DeLand. And few people know about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down. I am Ellen Palenha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman reported her name and sat down in the luxurious chair. She seems convinced that as long as a name is reported, the opposite player will understand everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie did understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really the Marquis of Palenia. Are you still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is enough to have a name. All the clues are strung together, confirming Bonnie’s absurd assumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellen Palennia, founder of the Royal Security Department and the Modern Intelligence Organization, is known as the "saint of the nation" and is young God chose to become a voter. She was active in the era more than four hundred years ago, and assisted the emperor at the time to defeat the most powerful Pope, Brand VII, and ended the period of church division with violence. In her hands, the Royal Security Department was formed to deal with potential enemies inside and outside the emperor. Shortly after being named as the first Marquis of Palenia, Palenia was attacked by the opposing Pope Brand. The two voters died here and destroyed the city of Palenia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bonnie immediately felt wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. You are not a living person, but you are not a dead or immortal. Is it related to the curse here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is worthy of being the most outstanding figure of the Southern Church. Its talent is no less than that of the opposite Pope Brand. Yes, this is the legacy of Pope Bland. He sacrificed his identity as a voter. Trying to destroy all the emperor's allies with the withered curse to establish the eternal Holy See; but his ambition is too great, and other gods can't tolerate it. With my voter, he took his fate and inherited his curse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the fate... Have you been the voter of the goddess of fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, until now. As a price, I became part of the city and this curse. I am not dead or able to leave. Just like this piece, once I am down, I can’t repent. This world is like a game of chess, all of us. People, all countries, are just pieces on the board."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elian grabbed a black oblate piece and placed it on the board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like swordsman when I am alive, but there are no opponents to accompany me to practice swords. So, I have to study a variety of chess and games here. As fun. This is the new Oriental chess that I got more than ten years ago. It seems to be more interesting than chess and diplomacy. In this game, both sides must build their own plans through the shackles, contain and destroy each other’s strategic plans, let The opponent's pieces can't form a string of interconnected. The Orientals call this action 'Slayer', which is very image. I think this kind of chess should probably be called 'Tragon's Chess.' Interested in coming to a plate?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie shook her head, didn't sit down, continued to stand and said: "The curse here sounds quite similar to the elf undead empire. No wonder the Empire dares to activate a Necromancer, immortal Being a security minister is because of your existence. If the entire security department is controlled by a different world, it is not so dangerous to use the immortal as a security minister."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;艾莲A pair of glasses, a sharp flash in the eyes: "Aha, Miss chess player, you are starting to leave. I always need a security minister who can communicate with the current empire, even if he is actually loyal to the wilderness, to me. It doesn't matter. A player who can touch the idea and purpose is better than the player I don't know the purpose and the idea. In my current 'Dragon', the interests of the Great Wasteland and the Empire are currently consistent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not afraid to burn your hands, Marquis of Palenha?" Bonnie couldn't help but refute, "You can't even have this room." Leave, just be sure that you can play this game well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chess is not always able to win. I just hope that when we win I can reserve a little more resources for the next set; when I want to lose, I can lose less. I didn’t think of it at the beginning, and the unified church would turn into a horn of greater division. When their theology develops again, we even Even the enemy to be defeated can not be found, and finally The empire was torn apart. In the case of the Freedom of War, our Royal Security Department lost very badly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and the Undead Empire are not afraid to lose even worse? For them, we are all dead. What good is it for the empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the back of the lens of Ai Lian's glasses, the sharp eyes are shot like a sword. It seems that the hobby of the female Marquis was probably the practice of practicing the sword, Bonnie thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say, my purpose is to save the world, would you believe it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was twenty, I believed that I was fighting for justice. Until now." Ellen Palenha’s mouth floated for the first time with a smile. "But it’s not your purpose, it’s you. What do you want to do. I guess, you want to destroy the entire trade route through the Great Wilderness, right? The trade route that connects the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonnie shook her head. "Not that I want to destroy. But the trade route will surely be destroyed. The ocean will definitely replace the land. Even if you successfully annihilate all our fleets, the sea trade route will replace the land trade route." The undead empire was originally based on the curse. Once the business road disappeared, it will inevitably embark on the road of extinction. I feel that the decision made by the Princess of the Coman family is better than the choice of the Marquis. The sea trade route is bound to be established, and we will find ways to control part of it in the hands of the empire. It’s not in vain to form alliances with the living or dead elves and fight against us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not necessarily, young players. Maritime trade is expensive I have seen more than once the Lu Xinhai trade and the Southeastern sea trade flourished and then disappeared. When the big ship sailed out and no longer came back, when the greedy rulers of the East and Muellerman began to rob, the maritime trade would disappear, and the goods And wealth is still steadily passed through the Western Tang and the Undead Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elian grabbed a piece of chess and sprinkled it on the board, pointing to Bonnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every game is new. Sometimes, five or six children will survive; sometimes, dozens of dragons will be slaughtered. If I were you, I would not bet on all the maritime business roads. Once your business road is built, it will definitely become an accomplice to tearing peace. They will provide too much power to the phase port and then transport it to Foti. Fort and Pylo became the army. Except for the southerners who played with you and the maddening Murrayans, no one wants to see this business road become so huge. You can obviously achieve stability through the church. Wealth, why do you have to gamble on this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is not a game for me." Bonnie replied, "Maybe for you. This is a big game, but it is not for me. I know that maritime trade will win, just as I know that the empire can't recover the whole south. The system of the great wilderness and the empire is too weak to adapt to the next era. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Lai Pa Virginia know in the past 400 years, unfortunately, Bonnie Sai Feier know the next two years. These two women, who are very similar in nature, across the board, realized that they could not convince each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the negotiations are broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Lai sighed, slowly Take off the glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her glasses and seemed to be another person - no, maybe it should be said to have changed from a person to a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie took a deep breath and rubbed all the muscles and nerves around him. From the time she set foot on this land, she left every part of her strength and prepared for the breakdown of the negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One party is the current electorate of the goddess of fate, and the other is the first person of the Protestantism who has reached the top of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confrontation between the two top theft users is enough to change the rules of this small alien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ionet Hartman, who was just entering the first floor of the building, was suddenly raised his head. The Cardinal found that he could not reach the power of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on here?! It’s just like all the gods of the gods are cut off by unidentified forces!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked in surprise, but no one answered him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real mistress of the Royal Security Department put down his glasses, stood up and began to clean up the pieces on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, still younger Bonnie couldn’t help himself, saying: “You can’t leave me in this room.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you shouldn't lie, the curse will keep you from dying, but you shouldn't leave this room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The Marquis will A piece of chess is placed in a wooden box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie was stunned. The belief in the other party has been sharp as a sword, but the answer is so dull, so she can't figure out how to continue this conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, so...when the negotiations broke down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the negotiations broke down Of course, we have to finish this game. I can't leave you, can you go back? Or, what else do you want to talk to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, then why do you want to take off your glasses?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I want to suggest that you don't break my room. It's very troublesome to fix. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Bonnie took another moment and suddenly turned and walked out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels like you lost a hand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie snorted, soon I found an analyst in the security department and asked him to lead the way to find the delivery point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission anchor point is the empire's standard, full of the unique password and drawing method of the empire, Bonnie can't fully grasp it, but it does not affect her back to the original world. However, she realized a huge problem -<br /><br />&nbsp; The point system and the republics are of course different. The Royal Security Department has several transmission points, but of course it does not include Phase Port. From the time when Bonnie was forced into the outside world, she could not return to the phase port for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it really makes her win first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say close to the phase In Hong Kong, she did not even have the passwords for interpreting the positioning coordinates near the core of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of positioning points can be counted by two hands, each looking so remote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it...just pick one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She complained, finished it back To the magic of the original world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sky is completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chill hit the body of Bonnie. Cold, very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Auntie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie Seifer slammed a sneeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the nose seems to have wet things. She blinked and made sure she didn't feel wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is snowing here. Although she couldn't see the snow because of the dark night, the feeling at the foot should be snow. It seems that this place is far and far from the north, and is very different from the warm climate of the subtropical phase port in the early spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid this is the northern border of the empire... It seems a bit far from here to go to the phase port? This distance, even the letter can not be reached?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie smiled and smacked the snow on his body and walked to the place where he could see the light. At least not in the wilderness or in abandoned ghost towns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there should have been won there, even if I can’t go back, I should have no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie said optimistically to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she doesn’t know is that at this moment, Nami is madly hoping she will be able to return to the phase port as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
