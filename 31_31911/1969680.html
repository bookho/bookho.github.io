If it is normal, the church bells all over the city will announce the present time, but now there are only rumbling sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of Captain Soledon came out of the headquarters and walked along the north edge of the second wall, carefully avoiding the shelling area, and each team The passing patrol is facing the password. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After crossing a quarter of the city, he left the second district from the east gate and returned to the familiar East Third District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenny's every city wall is divided into a district, the whole city is divided into four directions of east, west, south and north and five walls. Different administrative divisions. The area from one wall to the second wall is called the second area, the area from the second wall to the third wall is called the three area, the area from the three walls to the four walls is called the four areas, and so on. The city's Nanxun is close to the Mt. Bixi River, so the southern area is only up to the South Third District, and the four walls and five walls are only to the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Grace's Welfare Home is also located in the East Third District, but there are many street blocks built with sandbags and bricks on the nearby streets. . The shooting holes and traps on the walls of all the houses have also been opened, and the magic traps have been re-erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers that last time he was sitting with a taxi in Anne’s rental car; now, even if he searches for the entire Lenny, he can’t find it. Even if I rent a carriage. All the horses were requisitioned by the military to provide capacity for the fierce battle against the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the welfare home, his footsteps are getting slower and slower: the surrounding streets are familiar and unfamiliar, and most of the shops and mansions have changed signs and Famous brands, there are many brands on the door that are "sold" or "relocated". Here is Lenny, but it is not the Lenny that he knows. The changes that have taken place in the past few months seem to add up more than all the changes in his memory for more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood at the door and did not ring the door. It was quiet around, probably because the children had not yet got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am back." The door was told to himself with a low voice that no one could hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his home. Home is where you can come back at any time. However, when a man wanders outside and does nothing, he usually does not want to go back to his hometown. Silent homesickness is like a frost, not entangled and easy to melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed his head and wanted to search for a poem from his memory; unfortunately, he was just a crappy magician, not a poet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am back," Captain finally reached out and licked the door and said, "Is anyone there?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one should answer, he doesn't feel surprised. Now in wartime, the empire's artillery is placed outside the fourth wall, and the bullets that don't have long eyes may fall by hand at any time. Besides, the welfare homes do not have to be locked, and no thief has ever been interested in patronizing such places - except for the amateur thief who lives here. He thought so, couldn't help but lick a few fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chapel is still the same, the nuns of Weilun will only wipe the place she has enough, and the place above the gaze is covered with a thick layer of dust. Soledon walked into the door and just heard the nun doing morning prayers. He silently put a sac on the last row of benches, listening to the pledge of Sister Verentina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that the gods coexist, understand each other, believe in righteousness, and have a treaty. I believe that people have free will, everyone is an interpreter of the will of God. Execution. May the gods bless us to win peace.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun’s back looks so thin – why didn’t he find it before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last prayer was heard, the door fell from the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the wife and wife, nun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Wei Lun turned Come here, looking at Sorleyton without surprise, came over and picked up his bag - the attitude was as if he just went out in the morning to buy something back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door took a deep breath, took off the soil on the military uniform, and bowed and replied: "I am back, nun."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome back." The nun said, "What do you want for breakfast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager recalls those unpalatable porridge and Multigrain bread, nodded: "The old look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old look is not, there are too few people living in these days, too lazy to use the stove. But yesterday In the evening, I went out to eat, and I came back with it. Would you like to eat it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That’s welcome.” Naimen added another sentence, “Since You have already decided to eat leftovers, so don't ask!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Wei Lun laughed: "Though this is said, but before me I will ask you every night. No one asked these days, it’s a bit unaccustomed.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nun threw his bag on the worship table On, gently whistling the slogan of the hymn, walking to the kitchen Resistant door with her back. Yesterday's leftovers were in wooden boxes and placed on two large ice. Now Lenny can't buy ice, but there is a good magician around Sister Verentina. She has always used the magic of Zalt Fran to save the endless food. The nun took the dish out of the wooden box, half a pig's elbow and two half-baked steaks - even with the standard of the Free Army captain, it was a gorgeous and horrible meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the very elegant wooden box, the fist of the door is tight. He knows that he has been detained: Renika is a man who will run home like him. He asked if nothing happened: "This hotel looks good. Did you have a guest yesterday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Verentina squinted disdainfully. "Your Annie came to me to have dinner here last night, and hurried away. Even if it is a war, it is too hasty. Are you getting along with each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...ah... probably no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is ready to deal with the nun and think. Things are already obvious: Jenny has become an Annie with Yi Rong Magic and has come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy Magic is hard to completely turn a magician into another real person. Usually they don’t dare to use it. It’s too easy to be exposed. But the situation of Renee and Anne is different. They are friends, and they will not go wrong in the basic response. Of course, they also have plenty of magical materials. Female mage often exchanges hair as a commemoration of friendship. It is a fashion - well, don't talk about them, even he himself hides in the spell material bag. Their hair is ready to cope with the need. His collection of women's hair is not as many as men's, but it is also very impressive in number...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Nana suddenly found himself gone, shook his head Shake your head and start the analysis again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was already ten hours faster than me last night. Moreover, she is now the hero of the Free Army, Lieutenant Anne Safir, except me. In addition, even the closest relatives can't see her. She also got a full set of passcodes, except where she can't leave the city, wherever she goes. If I were her, which way would I go?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is thinking too focused, not paying attention to the nuns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I gave her the brooch that I hit four years ago, that is the brooch with turquoise and red crystal. She also started Very polite, all kinds of push and drag; finally it was only necessary to accept it. After receiving it, she was restless, and after a quarter of an hour, she hurriedly left. There is really no problem between you and her? I can still count on this. The girl can be your wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which thing, nun, don't guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Resist the door to deal with, with the corner of the eye to squat the nun's movements. Sister Verentina divided the roast pork knuckles into three servings and placed them in three plates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Wei Lun began to cut the steak into small pieces and fry it in the pan: "Yes, you are going to wake up the card. This girl is so big, actually still bed, I really don't know how to live outside. What kind of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was once again fell from the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I’m coming back from Nika, nun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ah, I didn’t say it just now? Anne of your family walked for less than an hour, and she was rushed back. I just picked up her room. I wanted to live for Anne and live for her. It’s just right.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that “Is Anne really coming back” flashed through Soledon’s mind, but he immediately denied this possibility Sex. An hour is too short, and Sister Weilun can believe in this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let me call her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is eaten by three mouthfuls Food, secretly pick up the bag of guns and spell materials placed aside and walk out the door. As he filled the bullets into the gun, he reconstructed the actions of Seneca last night in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s understandable to rest for a night, and it’s important to restore your strength. But why should she come back with her own identity? First, become Annie’s. She returned home and was warmly received by the nun. Then she took the brooch and rested in uneasiness. She probably squatted outside for a while, then lifted the magic and returned to the nun with her true identity. I lived in the room that was originally prepared for myself..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped in front of Yanika’s room and gently pushed the door open with his left hand. Showing a seam. The room was dark and the bed seemed to be someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not completely illogical. It is really incomprehensible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a foot Open the door, rushed in, and the right hand prepared vertigo on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty quilt collapsed. The door was turned sharply and pulled out of the gun to point in the opposite direction. There is no one else. He shrugged and muttered "Sure enough" and opened the quilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one red army sergeant uniform of the Freedom Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She doesn't need an officer status? It's really impossible to understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaking his pockets. A small black box jumped out of the top pocket and fell on the bed. He guessed that it should be the brooch that the nun wanted to give to Anne. I don't know why, I didn't take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sorry, or..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the box to open. To his surprise, the box was empty, and there was only one gap in the place where the jewelry should have been inserted. Renee left the box and the military uniform, but took the brooch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small paper group slipped from his fingers. In terms of expansion, it reads "Give Anne? Sefer", which is the handwriting of the nun, and the ink is still very new. There are traces of nails on the paper. He looked around the room as if there were no more traces of her left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awful, it’s really clean." Naomi lie down on the bed of Jenica, thinking irritably. "She won't get into the Free Army." But will she choose to wait for an opportunity or take a secret route?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Sister Weilun came from the door of the room: "If you want to find someone to help You chase Nika, and Zalt is now in the army. He is a volunteer mages in the Third National Division and is on duty at the East Second Wall during the day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door slammed the military uniform to the side and bounced up from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know she is not in the same camp as you. You must feel that only you can stop her alone, and only you can take her from the inevitable Salvation in the tragic ending?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen heard the irony in this sentence, but nodded. "The war is coming to an end. She is still there and may be affected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I am gone. The Third National Guard, 'Double-edged Sword' is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Along the way. If you find something and you don't think about it Similarly, you have to learn to give up at the right time; once you have to make a choice, you must know which one you want to choose..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;薇Sister Lun had wanted to talk about it again, but Naimen had already taken his own bag and hurriedly left. She looked at the back of the boy and shook her head with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and women are sometimes very stubborn. If you forget, it’s useless to say it. Let the young people handle it themselves."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sonyka should leave in the morning, I am still behind She is three hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the welfare home, Naimen? Captain Soledon did not rush to find the teacher, but returned to the second wall , to investigate the current situation. The medal of excellence that he just got is his best pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the imperial city’s siege began, only two regular divisions and nine militia divisions were recruited in Lenni, concentrated in and out of the five walls. A huge force of more than 100,000 people. If you don't consider quality, the number of free troops in the city is more than the number of emperors attacked in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His teacher, Zalt Fran, as a mid-level mage with formal qualifications from the Wizards Association, and a naturalization escape from the north Naturally, I also received an order to collect the military mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third "double-edged sword" National Guard is originally the reserve force of the most powerful Intres. The invitation to receive this militia division also indirectly proves the strength of Zalt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the door to the door? Captain Solerton, the Western General Army is affiliated with the Jena Army combat staff. I want to see a teacher named Zar Special Fran's volunteers with the army mages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am honored to accept your order, Captain. The chief of Fran will arrive later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for the notice, the overly young captain stood on the highest second wall, overlooking three-quarters of Lenny’s view against his combat map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenny, the capital of the free nations, his hometown, the third largest city in the world, and the iron wall of the north bank of the Methby River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfamiliar with fortifications, it is difficult to see where the boundaries of the two walls are. Unlike the well-defined loops or moats on the modern city maps of the later generations, Lenny's two or three walls are a whole. It is not so much a two-city wall, but rather a large semi-circular area with a large number of fortified homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom war between the North and the South has been going on for more than a hundred years. Over the past 100 years, people have built a zigzag-shaped staggered wall on this fertile land, which constitutes the necessary landscape for the grand narrative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and second walls were built during the time of the Holy Empire, and the third wall was established in the early days of the Freedom of War. The two walls are tall and steep, and the three walls are heavy and thick. There are not ordinary streets and houses between the two walls, but a complex defense system consisting of several moats, diversion ditches, bastions and dark castles. The renovation and construction of almost every house must be approved by the Freedom Army's fortification experts. Every design improvement of the barricade defense system was exchanged with blood. Four free wars were fought. Only the famous Lenny members of the family died more than 700,000. The memorial to their martyrs was full of three. Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a map of Lenny that the staff officer has the right to hold, which is in contrast to the actual scenery. At least four hundred hidden work magics are marked on the map, and each of the free army's eunuchs can activate these magic. In order to prevent leaks, the defensive magic table on each map is different. The total number of magic hidden in the street may exceed 2,000. Now these magics and traps have all been ready, ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which thick book is the second secret map? We volunteers don't have this thing. The logistics department only has a good job, but the other is simply It is intended to use our folk mage as a cannon fodder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Soledon turned around, he saw his teacher. To his surprise, Zalte Fran’s face seemed to be better in the past few weeks. How to see him is not like the kind manager of the past, but more like a real one than the doorman himself. With the army mages. The unscrupulous middle-aged man waved his hand in front of his forehead and took the right to be a military ceremony. When I saw the middle-aged man’s shoulder, there was only the Zhongzhangzhang, and the door-to-door was only slightly returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long time no see, teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt stared at the shoulder badge of the door, Jokingly said: "Your rank can be higher than me, Captain Soledon's staff. Under the command of Marshal Fox, the entire Lenny Army is learning your brave deeds. God, that is a real excellence. Zhang, this war hasn’t sent out a few pieces yet.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is looking around. No one else was nearby, but he still lowered his voice: "Teacher, that hero...not me. I don't have any memories of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalte Wrinkled, found a clean place on the wall of the wall, and whispered, "What? Is there a secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The door has sorted out all the things, and the idea is clear: "It was the credit that Ninika pushed to me. In order to destroy the contact between Lenny and Jena, she blew up the transfer point. In order to guarantee freedom. The army will not send people to chase her. She has lost this credit to me... Now, even I can’t push this medal. It’s not just my honor, it’s more involved. The morale and face of the entire Free Army. And as long as I don’t tell the truth, it’s impossible to mobilize the army to stop her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the narrative is very simple, Zalt still quickly grasped the key: "So you come to me. In this case, It is not convenient to mobilize any army, but I should have some troops in my hand to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded and said: "Yes. She is very good. She used the chain of honors to make the entire Free Army unable to move. I can only track her traces by my own strength, and now she is still leading me for about three hours."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt thought about it and asked: "You worked so hard because you want to save her before the end of the war. So, the Jena army is in a good situation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. If the current situation, as long as Lenny can hold on for a week, the Empire will not dare to step in the next step in the next two decades."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On this issue, I can really help you. In fact, you are less than three hours behind her, she left here two hours ago." Zalt Come out, "Let me your map."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was handed over to the map. Zalt turned to the page of Lenny's full picture. Seeing that there was no mark of the war since the outbreak of the siege, he wrote a pen and explained the mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First look at which road she might take out of the city. On the afternoon of the 6th, the North 5th District fell. On the 7th to the early morning, the Imperial Defence Forces expanded the results and broke through the East 5th District. In the morning, the General Command was attacked by Imperial agents. Afterwards, he decided to withdraw the defense line of the West Fifth District and burn the entire five districts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fire has burned All day, it has not been extinguished so far. The slanting gray shadow on the map was replaced by the burning ruins in reality. But even such a brutal and decisive act did not stop the imperial main army that had not lost its casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the afternoon of the 7th, there was only a sporadic battle. On the evening of the 7th, the Soma Principal Engineers carried explosives to blow up the water gate of the East Fourth Wall and broke into the East Fourth from the most southeast side. At midnight, after six hours of fighting and armed cover, the civilians were evacuated and the Free Army evacuated from the East Fourth District, ensuring the safety of the riverside fortress only in the area along the river. Today, the early morning of the 8th, a full-scale gun broke out. In the battle, the peripheral barricade area entered a fierce battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen conceived an activity armor map in his mind, which is an essential skill for combat staff. However, this scene is not very optimistic. He was surprised to ask: "On the two-day general attack, the city wall in the northeast has been compromised two times!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is due to the big detection The net is damaged. If the big detection network is still complete, we will not lose so badly. The big guys above..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance The face of the door was red and red. As a person who used the cracking bomb to knock out the big detection net, he did not want to continue this topic. If he is seriously pursued, he has a great responsibility for this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These things, even if they don't know all of them, they know most of them." Zalt contrasted the map. "The West, North, and East 3rd districts have all issued a comprehensive ban, and Seneca went to the east in the morning." In the future, I will be stopped when I look back. The two best regular teachers are concentrated in the North 4th District and the East 3rd District, ready to attack the siege troops assembled by the Emperor."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was thought out and asked: "What about the underground waterway?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The underground waterway leading to the four districts Last night, explosives and detection nets were urgently deployed, which could be detonated at any time. The moat near the city wall was full of water, and all the entrances and exits were guarded by the troops. She did not wear military uniforms now, and she was the identity of the magic goods supplier. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door leaned on his teacher and said: "This identity will not be you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Zalte waved his hand and argued: "I don't know she is thinking about going out of the city. She is this morning. I came out and said that I had figured it out, and I got the understanding between you and my father. I asked her to help me with the medicine. After she finished, she went to the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many orders did you take?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The order for the Berserker potion, I have a quarter. The demand for explosive potion is relatively large. I have a contract of 3,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt doesn’t want to talk more, pulls the subject back: "I can probably guess she will finally Which way to choose. You still remember, I told you that Lenny has a structure of underground passages that is different from the sewers. There are no controllable entrances and exits. If you are in danger, you can escape from there."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door immediately remembered: "There is no tunnel to control the entrance and exit... Are you saying that the Imperial Tibetan Golden Tunnel? But no one knows all the entrances and exits of the Golden Tunnel." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Tibetan Golden Tunnel is a famous joke in the history of the Republic. At the end of the second free war, in order to repay the high war bonds, the ruling party and the opposition party had great differences in policy. The ruling party proposed to increase taxes to solve the problem of public debt, while the opposition party proposed to find out the "hidden gold buried by the nobility during the Great Revolution" to solve the fiscal deficit. Surprisingly, the opposition party won a great victory in the general election, so the vigorous "Imperial Tibetan Gold Excavation Plan" began. This excavation lasted for three years, doubling the area of ​​the underground sewers in Lenny, but ultimately nothing. This black history disintegrated the opposition party and shattered the first bipartisan system, thus bringing federal politics into its first chaotic period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt used his fingers to draw a big circle on the map: "Yes, these tunnels have been idle for seven or eighty years, and the exits have almost collapsed." Can not be used, the Free Army also feels that it is impossible to use these tunnels for both ordinary people and enemy forces - but I don't remember that I have taught you two to be so useless."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a problem with the door that did not figure out: "But, when I dug so many tunnels, which one should I choose -"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about their motivation to dig these tunnels. Where is the chance of finding a buried entrance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is hard to beat My own head: "I am stupid. To excavate the Imperial Tibetan gold, it is naturally from the Duke of Lonnie's Mansion. The Lenny Library."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also Two hours behind. At this time, it is not enough for Junica to clear the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager stood up in a hurry and nodded and thanked him. "Thank you for your comments. I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher Zalte raised his hand and stopped him: "Wait a minute. Can you take a look at your excellent chapter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The door was taken off the medal and handed over to the teacher. Zalt Fran took out the monocle from his pocket and looked at the circuit and structure above. The mouth also praised: "The generous and delicate structure is really a great masterpiece.
