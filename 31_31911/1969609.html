			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flagship of the inland river fleet is on the port of Lenny Port before the dawn of the 23rd . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Klad; Lieutenant General Lopez and Wiener; Admiral Betsy talked in the first morning light and walked down the ramp, there was a second-rate newspaper. The reporter was dozing off in a dilapidated carriage nearby. He was awakened by the snoring of the pilot, squinting and waking up to get to the river to find a place to wash his face, but just caught up with this scene. As a Fagas, the reporter recognized the three big stars on the shoulder of General Redbeard with only one glance. Before the guards continued to catch up with the strong sergeants, the black carriage of the newspaper disappeared into the dense fog of dawn. At the time of breakfast, the newspaper containing this news has been spread on the table of thousands of households. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outside! Commander-in-Chief of the Farnes Military Region, the only general officer of the Free Army, Wiener; Lord Betsy arrived at Lenny in the early morning!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The commentator of the newspaper: the statement of the French republic and the parliament will have a decisive influence on the attitude of the provincial parliaments. Wait and see: Is Admiral Betsy bringing peace or war?" "Editor: We must not allow politics to become a precedent for the past. Cracks will be found under the high tower foundation of our government. Every soldier who abandons the Constitution must be punished with the utmost punishment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the public opinion is so excited There is a reason. In the past two weeks, the newspapers supported by the main war parties and the main and party parties were divided into camps with clear positions, using words as weapons to attack each other. Conservative, liberal, and provincial parties firmly support the quick fix, while real and federal parties struggle to maintain hope for peace. A large number of middle-party members are hesitant, and the provisional parliamentary vote has fluctuated between one-third and two-thirds long, and no one can gain an advantage. People are waiting for a decisive stimulus – either from the Confucian capital Kegler’s Peace Envoy or from the French capital Paolo’s draft resolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing that comes is the latter. People didn't know which Admiral Betsy decided to stand on, but they all knew that he had brought Fause's decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...There will be a showdown finally." Reese sighed and put together the last newspaper and threw it in an empty chair. Already there are eight newspapers, and there is still only one person on the side of the extended table. The blonde girl looked at the breakfast on the table: the milk was already cold, and the bread no longer had a roasted aroma. Her sister has gone to Kengler for a week. The half-elf, who used to sit in the second position of the top, is now on the Metebeisi River, guarding the docks of the capital without being bombarded by the rebel fleet. Since recruiting a group of alchemists who helped study, the hostess of the mansion has been working late and getting up late, getting up late, rarely coming over for breakfast. So, only Reese is left; Seifer is here for breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most powerful magician of this era picked up the cold bread and hesitated. He did not ask the maid to take it back and sent it directly into his mouth. Cold bread and cold milk have no taste, but are enough to provide enough energy for a busy morning job. The role she needs to play now is a rigorous, reliable, loyal and impartial manager who represents the entire consortium and its majestic and proud hostess. She is in charge of the group's decision-making, her mistress represents the authority of the group, and her sister is in charge of the operation of the group - in theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In theory..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese smiled bitterly. She can take charge of the entire group's decisions, but she hates this unchanging trouble. She likes to watch asset growth, technological progress, and scale expansion is her sister Bonnie; Seifer, not her. She believes that Reza does not like the cheesy nickname "Golden Lady" and will always be fascinated by her own research. Fortunately, as a spiritual leader, Reese does not need to show up regularly; Reese and Bonnie have also been very cautious in shaping the alchemy's supremacy in the entire group to ensure that when they leave Lenny The consortium will not collapse - they know what Reesa is; Hermonte is also very suitable for this identity. The lowest-level staff only knows Reza; Hermont, who does not know the Sefers as actual operators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell of the parliament building sounded again. Seeing that it was already ten o'clock in the morning, Reese stood up from the table and shook the bell to call the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call the cook to make a new breakfast and send it to Ms. Hermonte's room. You have eaten breakfast on the table."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that even if she leaves, it doesn't matter? Even if she and her sister are not here, should everything be normal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she thought about it, she suddenly felt a magic in her fingertips and blood. Recently her magic has gradually become uncontrolled and gradually becomes wild, no longer as precise as before - or two and a half centuries later. There are not so many magic theories, magical knowledge, and magic experiments in this era. The world of the mind is not as big, complex, and perfect as it is in the future. That feeling... like a slight electric shock, or the pleasure of accelerating the magic over your body. She told herself that at this critical moment of chaos, there may be something more important than waiting for news and taking care of everyday affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not yet. The situation is not yet fully clear and cannot be acted upon. Reese; Safir's character is activist, she does not have the vision and planning ability of her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the Magical Items Division today, and today's new information must be sent to Bonnie. Tell her that the war is imminent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ressed out a little after finishing the appearance, she did not put a coat of arms painted with a white rose on her chest. Before going to Kengler, Bonnie had repeatedly beat her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, you use a white rose, and I use a black rose. If there is a situation that is difficult to contact, just use the rose or the sign as a signal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can roughly guess the reason why Bonnie insisted: it is a commemoration of a secret organization. The secret organization, called "blood roses," was a huge secret female organization in their time, manipulating the direction of the world. There is only one point she still doesn't quite understand: there are only six responsible persons in the organization. The three primary colors are red, yellow, blue and tri-color orange, purple and green, and there is no white or black. Reese did not know why her sister would choose these two plain and unremarkable colors. She thought she would choose blue, representing Melia Yan; Quillahiya her own blue. Reese knew that her sister liked blue because she chose the blue logo for the group's magic items division: a diamond with blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The openwork diamond bent in silver is flashing on the northernmost wall of Lennie, next to the Metterby West River named King River tributary. The slight blue light from the silver wire during the day is only faintly visible; but at night, the blue light of the diamond is enough to penetrate a block. In order to show the strength of the trading line, the guards here are all shining in the body, the house is covered with alarm magic and detection magic, and various traps are arranged by magic items. The sound of the alarm and the sound of the blade not only did not affect the trading of the trading bank, but with the help of rumors and rumors, the name "Blue Diamond" was picked up. In just two weeks, it was the best magic item transaction in Lenny. The ranks of the line - only a few people know the relationship between this magnificent watch of magic goods and the "pure gold underwear store" whose reputation is not very good. The foreman on duty today did not know the blond girl in front of him, but he recognized the white rose coat of arms representing the highest agent and immediately gave up the road leading to the back of the counter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, don't have to inform the store manager."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rui Ribbon for business The smile walked into the first storeroom of the trading house and sat down on the only chair. A sensation of numbness passed through the backrest, soothing her fatigue in the past few days. This chair is attached to the magic from the East. It can soothe muscle soreness through the mysterious "acupoint control". It is one of the rarest and most practical magic items they collect. Just sitting for a while, she didn't want to stand up again - it was so tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, I understand why she wants to move the information center here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; lamented the luxury life that my sister enjoyed on weekdays, and Reese finally got the spirit and began to flip through the reports of mountains. Most of the information can be lost as long as you read the title. The value of those things is not as good as the "historical history books" they carry with them. The most important thing was the information related to Admiral Betsy and the Fasuan Legion. She picked them out and put them in a metal cylinder. Relative to the amount of intelligence, the cylinder looked a little small; she used a metamorphosis to turn the information into the shape of the roll toilet paper, and stuffed it into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is how to send this information to Bonnie, who is 300 kilometers away. The amount of intelligence is too large, and it is impossible to use tricks such as the "Resonance Board Transmission Method"; in the era of lack of transmission of coordinate data, transmission is also very inappropriate. As for the use of pigeons, crows, bats, owls and the like, it is full of danger and uncertainty. Although using these things will look like the legendary great magician, they are too unreliable: a slightly more professional archer or sniper can knock down the mage's pet and intercept these precious ones. intelligence. In the days of the Safirs, the Master generally relied on Absolute Teleportation and Airmail; but in this era, she was at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese suddenly remembered this thing and felt a ecstasy. She plunged into the pile of magical items and looked for the summoning medium that could be used until she turned out a cane with feathers and green gemstones as decorations. In her time, these magical items for summoning have lost their usefulness for pure decorations; but in this era, those items have real magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The starter is probably a flying man, a spirit of the wind element..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't bother to speculate on the start-up spell, but instead used the forcible start-up method of the later generations to inject the magic power into the staff. It was just the effort of shaking the wrist, and the almost transparent spirit of the wind appeared in front of her. In the face of her power, the Wind Elf has no attempt to make any resistance. Reese nodded with satisfaction and pushed open the window by the river, pointing her finger to the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, go down the river to find my sister's team. I am in the name of Reese; Seifer, you will not get it if you don't finish it. Freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the wind trembled and flew northward along the king's river, flying in the direction of Kengal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that Bonnie is doing well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kyleg, the capital of the Republic of Turk The name comes from the king's river that flows from his south side. Unlike the Metebysi River, it is difficult to sail on the river. The waterway that can really be used for navigation, that is, the section that is not long in the north of Lenni, and the passage from Kengler to Gonia (a section of dr; the section from Kengler to Lenni is called "reef turbulence"), completely It can't be used for general vessels to sail. Only very small boats can pass through this rushing, tortuous, full of dark beaches and reefs. Because the waterway is complicated and the land is full of thorns, the construction of Lenny will be later than Kengal. Much: During the First Dynasty of the Koman Empire, Lenny was established as an outpost for the southwest conquest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original meaning of the name of Kengal is "the king's City. The people of Ruhrlock have always been proud of the long history of their capital: when Lenny, DeLand and even the Elven Empire did not exist in this world, Kengler was already the largest city-state in the south of Lu Xinhai. However, Shiyi has moved from now on, from Rama, Lenni to Fort Pitt, and the flat-shaped area of ​​Pylo, also known as the "latitude 35 degree line" - has become the most prosperous region of the free country, Keng Le area For this reason, the Ruhrocks and the Lenny are always contemptuous of each other, and there is a deep gap between them. In the comedy staged in Kengal, there is always a devastating Lenny harlequin. In the comedy of Nepal, the Ruhrs who are self-respecting and bragging are not rare characters. For Kengal, choosing to support Radz, who was born in Ruslock; Marshal Govar, is really a matter of course. As soon as the break broke, the road from Lenny to Kengal was completely cut off.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you cross the river? When will this be maintained? I knew that when I had not had so many troops in the first two days, I should go through the customs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that from the north to the south, all the disciples of the king river are involved. It was blocked. The Fifth National Guard of the Government Army also blocked several passes to the north and the east, claiming that the soldiers of the coup army would never be close to the suburbs of Lenny."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a soldier, it is simply that even one person will not let it! West Bank The coup army, the east bank is the government army, and every ferry and the disciples are the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Royal Mile in the north has also been blocked, and there are countless The bandits were in the middle of the control area between the two sides. I heard that they had slaughtered several villages as bases."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of businessmen and travelers were blocked in the blockade On both sides, rumors are like dislocated wild horses flying in the town along the Royal Mile. Each town is crowded with hoarding merchants, mercenaries looking for opportunities, prostitutes who smell business, even the fifth of the government The National Guard and the Sixth Division of the Coup, the "Mitbi Xishi" blockade, is also difficult to prevent those flies-like outsiders from gathering in this area. Most locals are so happy that only the agents at the Lenny factory are frowning. People do not feel the imminent crisis, but they are immersed in the immediate interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, a caravan full of tight supplies can’t be left here forever. The caravans tried their best to make a difference, trying to pass the defense line of both sides and the middle area where the bandits were stolen. From the bribery, the lure, the threat to the disguise, the soldiers of the Freedom Army who are involved in the field and the blockade line can be regarded as the ever-changing capitalists. In the vicinity of Kenn's recent Dane Martial, the first two days, the caravan painted the carriage with the blue emblem of the Free Army, and found several veterans, trying to disguise the logistics column of the Free Army. The defense of both sides. They did succeed in mixing the National Guard militia and reserve officers, but they were seen on the side of the "Mitby West", and all the supplies were confiscated - it was a large number of muskets and gunpowder. This incident made the head of the Fifth National Division repent of the intestines, and the inspections became more and more strict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the command of the head of the regiment, the guard of the Dane's disciples involved in the field licked his nose. The team in front of us is not only a little suspicious... it can be said that it is too suspicious. But he is just a little evidence that he can't find the other person's smuggling of strategic materials. No food, no weapons armor, no magic items, no gunpowder cement. This team has only people and carriages, but they are not suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Manager, are you saying that you are... a performance group?" He hesitated and asked again, hopes to find out from the other's answer. Contradictory places come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we are volunteers for peace. My lady Miss Metty; Crosso is a famous genius piano and organist, famous. At home and abroad, I once held a concert at the United Theatre in Lenny. She is full of patriotism. I heard that our great motherland is facing division, and despite the opposition from the family, insisting on a goodwill concert in Kengal. A respectable lady, you actually let her stay in the country where the hot bath can't be washed for three days, three days! My grandfather has a good position in Lenny, don't let him know his most The beloved one-child daughter is treated like this here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general manager’s face is neat, well-dressed, with a black wide-brimmed hat and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. The tone was very high, and a sturdy look made it that the company commander could hardly speak. The company commander felt an urge to pull out the gun and kill the man in front of him, but he could only force it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, we are only doing routine checks to make sure that you really have no entrained contraband and magic items. Now the speculators who go to Kengal to join the coup army are really Too many, we can't catch it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have checked for thirty minutes, have you checked out? Even your mages are in battle." Then, with the probe stick knocked for a long time, is there something knocked out? Even a probe is not good, and it looks really anxious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The company commander looked at the magician apprentice who had not yet graduated, and expected him to give a satisfactory answer. The apprentice grabbed the probe and reluctantly spread the staller: "There is nothing in the team except the organ, piano, queen, trumpet, violin. There is no magic reaction on the instrument and the carriage. There is no suspicious. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company commander bite his teeth and finally glanced at the emblem of the "Crosso Brothers Bank" on the carriage. Everything is perfect, there is no flaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though it is so suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unwillingly spit out the word from his teeth: "release."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disgusted general manager squinted at him and went back to command the horse-drawn team to cross the river. This high-profile man is full of hateful self-confidence, and the company commander believes that he will certainly be able to pass the check of the "Mt. Bishop". An hour later, the investigators proved this for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the last company commander did not believe that the heads of these capitalists could do public welfare. "What are they smuggling?" He asked the adjutant with some irritability, but he couldn't get the answer - until many years later, all the wars ended and he still couldn't get the answer. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the investigation of the Matter West Division, the team continued to the north, and the annoying general manager also returned to his carriage. As soon as he got back into the carriage, he took off the heavy wide-brimmed hat and revealed the short brown hair that was trimmed neatly. The iron cylinder sealed with white rose heraldry has been waiting for him in the seat, along with the spirit of the wind element that has accidentally fallen into the sacred protective enchantment. The general manager smiled and waved the poor summoning creature back to its original world. After seeing the information sent by my sister, the beautiful girl dressed as a man’s dress frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Betsy is back... I hope it’s still too late. Why is Kegler’s special envoy not yet to Lenny? If you can’t, then we’re smuggling things. It’s time to catch up...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie talked to herself and destroyed the cylinder and intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not smuggle strategic supplies, she smuggles the organ: a huge organ that is cast in pure gold and white gold. It is enough to solve the pure gold and platinum of the financial crisis in Kengal, as long as she feels that the situation is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the best pastor of this era, along with the most savvy speculator in the world, Bonnie; Seifer herself . The young performer with her is also not idle - only she knows this. Reese did not read the historical document of "blood roses". She didn't know the weight of the name maidy crossive on the back of the history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
