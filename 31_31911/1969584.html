After receiving the high intelligence fee of fifty pounds, The waiter took them very warmly to the front of the secret room, opened the secret lock and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." The major school with the name of God of War on the chest said that after the thanks, the door opened, the god of deception and the goddess of fate followed him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decoration of the secret room is very inconspicuous, just an ordinary room, like a hotel where two shillings can stay for one night. There is no anti-magic array in the room, only some striking magic detection devices are on the surrounding walls. Not surprisingly, there are already people inside. A total of three people, all men: a skinny man wearing a strange high hat and dressed as an elf archer, with the name of the god of justice, Lesotho, on his chest; a tall and strong giant wearing the emperor’s costume, It is the god of travel, Travo; there is also a white mage robe sitting in the corner, with standard body, strong muscles, and obvious military temperament, and is not well-matched. The name is also God of Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are people who are interested in this topic." Seeing them coming in, the "God of Justice" first said, "Still, you Is it a seller?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, we are not." "Futila" chuckled, the smile filled with the charm of the hook. "At least, I am not, I can't be responsible for the two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not." Clad replied coldly. He is speculating that the masked soldier will be an acquaintance. There are indeed a lot of people who know the "vampire of the budget", especially in the Free Army and the National Guard. But those who can quickly associate with the current staff of the staff meeting and pay 50 pounds for it must be military intelligence. The leader among the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe that person still wants to wait for the buyer a little more?" The other god of war presumed, "80% he is going to let all interested people bid for the bid." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, the people who are interested in this partial intelligence are really a lot?" The fascinating god of destiny is sinking, "The letter The keywords are a bit embarrassing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not very embarrassing." The voice of the giant is exceptionally low and dull. "After all, the 'vampire of the national budget' is quite famous. The nickname. Controlling the keywords in this category ensures that everyone present has sufficient intentions and sufficient funds..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Because this intelligence system is too big and the value is too high, I dare not use the usual method to get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this voice, everyone Almost at the same time, I began to look around. Not only for the sudden appearance of this mysterious voice, but also for the familiarity of this voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the voice of the previous speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please don't look for it, I am not here. If it is here, it is likely to reveal identity, or be hidden by everyone." Kill it. Of course, this voice is not my own voice; I just borrowed the tone of the spokesperson. Mr. Salik, Mr. Travo, Mr. Lesardo, Ms. Futila, There are two Mr. Corell, let us start trading."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant man asked: "So, what should we call you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just call me a 'speaker'." The spokesperson continued. Although he said "he is not here", the meaning of the words is clearly saying "he understands everything here": At least, he can see the emblem of each person's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe he is one of the few people we are present?" Major Hull whispered to his chief, "There is always a feeling of a secret room murder... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is still not certain that there are many ways to control the situation when people are not present." Clad replied slowly. "There is no anti-magic array here." In addition, your detective novels are too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major as a detective novel fan and amateur reasoning writer closed his mouth. The rest of the people didn't talk, it seems that they don't know each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut." The little man snorted, but still took a small bag of gold coins and threw them on the table in the center of the crowd. The rest of the people also generously donated money and dropped money bags of different sizes on the table. Clade feels that this scene is a bit like a bard selling a legend... In essence, it seems that there is no difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is silent for a moment - don't know if it's counting money or just making a fool of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, it is about the movement of the Free Army. As we all know, the current chief of the Lenny defending force is Dico; Major General Lemda. And what I want to say is ... This person is Radz; a 100% crone from Gowar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This information is not hidden... I have heard similar rumors. Then?" The other god of war, Correll, was impatient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if I want to tell you again, I have enough evidence to prove that the commanders of the 10th Division of the Free Army, 'Lenny', and Govar The Marshal has a secret agreement. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Hearing this sentence, more than one person exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Radetz; Govar... Does he really want a coup?" Clade; Lopez whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The commander of the tenth division, shouldn’t it be Wiener; the people of Betsy?" "God of justice" supported the table and jerked up. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answer. In the middle of the table, a few letterheads appeared silently; it was a secret letter that wrote the names of the two parties. Everyone stood up, the strong "Trave" was the fastest, and reached out to the middle of the stationery; at the moment he touched the letter, the papers turned into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"幻幻!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too anxious. These things are for price." The voice of the spokesperson echoed without feelings and was filled with money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Controlling the nearby troops...Dardz wants to...?!" Hull; Major Tedwood holds the armrest of the chair tightly, knuckles green. "I want the intelligence network to confirm... isn't this a fake intelligence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe it." Clad's eyelids jumped, " Govar’s seniors will do this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why does Gowar want a coup? Motivation?" Hull whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because he is a somewhat paranoid patriot." Lieutenant General replied, "always."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Motivation?" The woman next to Hull asked, "What is his motivation?! Who supports him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Someone who is very influential in the parliament. Or, someone who is hidden in the darkness of the white building... This is the real intelligence, please ask for the price. Put the price on the table, one-time bid. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1000 pounds." "1500 pounds." "2000 pounds." "3,000 pounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;People bid one after another, and soon it was Clarke and Hull. The major who did not have such a large amount of money looked at his chief for help; Clad silently took out a small box from his pocket and placed it on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" asked "Furilla" on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad quietly opened the lid. Even ordinary lighting can be reflected in the box, reflecting the dazzling light. "The famous diamonds of the Murray Empire princes are enough to collect a resurrection magic. I hope that all the people here can hear this information. If there are any deficiencies, I will pay for them."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spokesperson seemed to be stunned, and it was only a long time before I spoke again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well, I will tell you. This behind-the-scenes person is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The sound is severely cut off. At this moment, the magic detection alarm on the surrounding wall suddenly made a big splash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the screams, a deep dark spell was silently launched, and the darkness immediately spread in the room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hull, counter-!" Clade's voice was a little impatient - Lieutenant General who had traveled for a long time in the East was not good at countering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glare!" Hull concentrated on trying to dispel this dark magic, but failed. "No... the magic is too strong, I can't resist it... ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic alarm sounded even tighter. There is more than one person, and at the same time, it is starting magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break the Dream!" For self-protection, Clade evoked the Flying Sword and placed the two under the defense of Blu-ray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken dream just flew out, there is no idea that something touched up; "咻", the blue light and the incoming object touched, making a harsh the sound of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there someone really attacking in secret...?" Klad’s heart sighed. "Is it because someone is unwilling to let others know the true face of the scene?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reverse, glare!" The "destiny goddess" on the side throws out the anti-magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light will disappear as soon as the light comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s hard to believe that female spies will have real skills..." As soon as the light resumed, the high school students of the Academy of Military Academy paid a respectful respect to the gorgeous girl. A note. Hull has always been confident in his skills, but he will also respect everyone who is really better than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad is completely devoid of this kind of leisure--he is watching the changes in the situation in the room. Everyone looks more awkward than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short "elf archer" hat was nailed to the wall by something unknown. He was getting up from the ground and licking the dirt on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall and burly giant seems to have tried to block the thing, but his left arm was stabbed, wrapped up in clothes, and still bleeding. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of the soldier in the corner does not seem to be hurt, but there is also a small ash in front of him who does not know what is scorched. Behind the lady, there is also a mysterious white object stuck in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And...the blood is suffocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Lopez turned his attention to the most bloody direction. I don't know when, there was a hidden door on the wall; the secret door opened, it seemed to be blasted by something powerful. In the secret door, there is a lie...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body. Wearing a hidden body with a discolored cloak. The corpse wears a servant's mask, and it must be a frightening expression under the mask. The cloak turned bright red as there was blood as a lining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People rushed forward and surrounded by the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a seller? It’s really bad to die." The little man sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what the secret information is, so that he is going to be ruined?" The giant Han squatted down and unveiled the mask. It is a typical thief face, without any features that people can remember. A person whose face is easy to be remembered cannot be a thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really there is a corpse..." The soldier dressed as a white robe mutter muttered, "This is still a secret room..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, this is a secret room murder." Hull; Major Tedwood took out the pipe from his pocket and licked it in his mouth. He slowly opened his mouth and his expression was serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrified expression appeared on the face of everyone except him and his chief. "What?!" "How is it possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarm is still ringing, ringing, but the rhythm slows down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation has already been the case, the thieves guild should be rushed soon." Hull stepped forward and kneel down to check the wound of the body. The wounds were all over the body of the deceased, and the bones were stabbed out of the wound. The secret door should have been opened at the last minute before he died - but it is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So cruel, what magic?" asked the little "God of Justice". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this question, people in the closet face each other. This unheard of bloody magic has never been heard of; it is not a kind of magic in the "positive rule" recognized by the Magic Arbitration Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily magic...may be some kind of magic, or the special ability of magical creatures." "Furilla" added, "I think it is possible It’s some kind of undead.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think so too.” Clade; Lopez picked up a ash from the table, “although by Ke Riel's magic is burnt, but it must be bone powder. I am afraid it is still a very powerful undead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It is hidden in us !! Hull asserted with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, how do you find out, Mr. Corell?" The soldier dressed as a white robe sneer, "Do you want us?" Are there any proofs that are not present?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Majors paused for a moment, "We can investigate each person's magical ability..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic ability? He jerked back. According to this standard, I am afraid that his chief's suspicion is the biggest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... It’s not okay to rely on the mystery novel. You have to find a way to force the murderer to shoot again. If you kill the person before the keyword appears, he It must be a perfectionist and does not allow any leaks to exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you can take advantage of this character's weakness? If you can let your opponent think that the information has been leaked out, he will definitely kill all the insiders before the investigators arrive at all costs, that is to say - if he has repaired the illusion field - <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, what you killed was only an unfortunate thief guild member." Before the majors planned the action plan, the spokesperson’s cold voice was once again It sounded. "The people of the guild will arrive soon, and they will investigate all your intelligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Another Currie's brow twisted into one group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The seller is not dead?" The little man stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This person is really among us?" The pipe in Hull's mouth fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the spokesperson is heated: "I will let you and the people behind you pay the price! I will Ladz; Gwavar intends to launch evidence of the coup Leaked to Wiener; Betsy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound was interrupted again at a critical moment. The magic detection device on the wall suddenly lit up - the reason why the alarm didn't say was because there was silence and the room was covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant "Travi" slowly stood up, sneered and said something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite intelligence officer who had been trained in lip language tried to recognize: "Too lazy, with you, these, useless, guys, acting... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for him to recognize all the words, the "God of Travel" has raised his right hand. As he snapped his fingers, the right hand immediately turned into a forest bone, and shot to five people! No mantra, no concentration, this guy is a real undead! The undead returned from the earth... the undead with wisdom is high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the bones flying, Hull habitually recites the spell of protective magic: "prote..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read here, he reacted violently. The silence in the field has not been lifted; how can it be effective now when I read the mantra? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rolled to the ground and tried to escape the bone arrow. The giant Han used his eyes to see his movements, his right arm trembled, and the bone arrow went straight to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the moment when the bone arrow is about to hit, a purple shield appears in front of him, blocking the bone arrow; a blue light sweeps again , the white bone arrow is broken into a powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
