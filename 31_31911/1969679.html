			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenmen? Soledon made a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his dream, he stood in front of the city’s central avenue, overlooking the Republic’s United Parliament building at the end of the boulevard, and the central library on both sides. Federal Museum. The former Grand Duke’s Mansion has only two of these annexes, and every day welcomes citizens who have come to the pilgrimage from all over the Republic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the city of destiny, the capital of the republics, Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crossroads symbolizes the four republics and is known as the "crossroads of freedom." It is said that if you stand here for a whole day, you will be able to see an old knowledge that has not been seen for many years in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he really saw the old knowledge, he immediately realized that this is not a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome back, Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this sentence, wearing it A water blue maid dress with a bright silver edge, smiled and nodded slightly, greeted him with a curtsy. Although he knew Anne Sefir, she was a maid to open a shop for her, but she never crossed such a long skirt and made such a standard etiquette. She was originally a girl who was more suitable for tight-fitting armor than a long skirt. And...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, hey, Lieutenant Sefer. Whatever the name of the 'master' is, regardless of the clothes?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She let go of her hand, put down the skirt of the long skirt, and looked up: "Is this not the time when the owner hired me to come to this store? Everyone must call Your master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My store?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the owner of you Shop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door turned and saw the store. That shop in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple signboard, simple decoration, but the customer's magic shop. On the slate next to the door, the words "Heroes of Freedom" and "Owners of the Medal of Excellence in the Union" are engraved. Annie skillfully pushed him through the door one step at a time, and the door entered the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The store has all the magical items he knows. Guests from the four republics, guests from the empire, the elves from Sanson were all in the store, and the female clerk in the maid costume received them attentively. In the corner, a Murrayman with a yellow headscarf was bargaining with the Interlaken dialect with a strange tune. Two Orientals in long gowns took an ancient book to look at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this really my store?" He couldn't help but ask again, "This store looks...very valuable."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny nodded. "What happened to you today, amnesia? This is of course your shop, master. The war is over."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, the so-called hero of freedom war, refers to me? I don't remember that I have received the Congress Medal of Excellence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course. You have made outstanding achievements, all of which are what you deserve, master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Nexen thoroughly confirmed this. The attributes of dreams. Imagine the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this will certainly not happen in reality. At the same time, he also realized that he had a very rare opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of dreams by magicians can be traced back to the first dynasty of Coleman. After liquidating the racist illusion of the "dream is the god" of the elf empire, the human wizards launched a vigorous discussion of the truth. The mainstream mages believe that dreams are the realization of faith. The prophetic school and the real school are tit for tat. The former points out that dreams must be some kind of topological distortion of the future destiny, while the latter is opposite to each other. It is said that dreams are nothing but the sum of memories and experiences of the past. Those mages who advocate static reality theory argue that dreams are the sum total of all intelligent creatures' understanding of the world. Space magic experts believe that dreams, like heaven and hell, are independent worlds of facts. There are also many theories that have not yet been developed in the age of resistance. For example, some people think that dreams are the reaction of the Oedipus complex or childhood trauma. But everyone agrees that dreams have their own power different from reality. There are a lot of magical magic coming from dreams, and many ideas are inspired by dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, look for the key point first. Anne is one, and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and looked for clues. The store's furnishings are “pure gold” open-ended sales, and each magic item is accompanied by an instruction manual or his own handwriting. In the corner, there is a wicker chair and a tea table for the rest of the guests. The oriental teapot made of white porcelain is displayed on the corner, showing the sincerity of the owner. He walked over and poured a cup of tea out and looked at it. The tea is full of fragrance and is the best fermented black tea, which contains the unique taste of the Eastern Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed the store of his dreams. However, he felt that something was not quite right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All dreams, or dreams, there are things that are not quite right, but dreamers are hard to detect them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thinking hard and he saw that the store door was pushed away again. Several maids waited for the arrivals and immediately bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have worked hard, the foreman sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women who walked in the door handed the bag I gave the maid next to me and noticed Anne who was checking the stock when I walked inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, the manager of Sefir is back. So, is the owner back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The tea in the mouthpiece squirted out. This time, I don’t have to go to find something wrong...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the lady who came in, called the "foreer sister" is his childhood friend, Now Princess Danny von Fegotta. She was dressed in a maid costume and walked in with a heavy iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not the same as other people, it is a Fegota-style skirt, more suitable for combat than the long skirt - of course, more Sexy, more suitable for attachment magic. Soledon knew the maid's army in the Principality of Figeta. When Renee surrendered, the troops she had left also caused some disputes. Finally, Naomi took into account their individual combat effectiveness and put the entire unit into the ranks of the officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Yanika? Why are you here too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So saying so It’s too much to see, Master. The foreman has to go out shopping time?” Renee dropped the iron box on the table in front of him. “Sometimes they will bring back the parcels. It seems to be a gift.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am not asking this question..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tongue froze The corner of the corner of the eye swept the signature on the parcel. Resist the door and take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a word on the "Royal Security Department Sid-Nasser". The door is unpacked and a card is dropped from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that your store sells everything and picks up any work. If this is your dream, I will send this store gift. Sid "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the convention, the signature is not a seal, but a handwritten signature. The paradox is that the font looks as neat and unfeeling as the standard body on the dictionary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Security means...The door is thinking, there is no clue. He hasn't figured out which magic items the store is selling until now, and he never thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter looks like a mockery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took another deep breath and gently opened the heavy black iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two bombs inside. The bombs are heavy-duty breakouts for Imperial Grenadiers, each weighing twelve pounds. There are ten pounds of finely sized fine gunpowder that can throw pre-tuned steel nails fifty meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bomb was seen, the surrounding maids exclaimed and fled. Only Anne and Yanika did not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is holding the breath. The nails are stuck in the meat and it doesn't hurt at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just in the middle of the two bombs, a necklace with a huge drop of sapphire inlaid with water. Unlike the one he has seen, the sapphire on this necklace is mixed with black stains. The black impurities are connected in a line and entangled on the surface of the stone like a snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously stretched his hand to the necklace, but suddenly remembered something and stopped: "Annie, Yanika, you also avoid it." Let me untie this bomb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't move with her. Since it is a dream, he did not force it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is my dream," said Nathan Soleton, saying to himself, "It’s my dream. I can do anything here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the black and blue intertwined gems with his trembling hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is your own dream,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-speaking becomes a second person . Even if something is wrong and some confusion, he should be able to control it. But the confusion of this dream made him flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the future of your own dreams,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what is the future? ? The uncoordinated two chains on the pendant should be the key. Breaking through the mystery of this dream, he can get more powerful magic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue and black wings, choose a loop Cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything calms down, only the mechanical impact of the clock pendulum echoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step. tread. Step on. Step on the step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not find out before, this store has so many alarm clocks as goods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this store selling? What do I want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that choice right? No... Which color did he choose? This doubt rushed to his heart and could not be stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, this is a dream, I can't be confused-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to blink . Don't want to blink. Don't want to blink. He stared at the black and blue intertwined chaotic gems, watching the patterns change, merge, and decompose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally blinked. Then, the wind blew, and he closed his eyes desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through the test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened his eyes again, the whole store It has been turned into a piece of rubble. Along with the screams of customers and clerk, the magical items exploded one after another in the flames, turning into colorful light and pungent smell, which was enough to sweep a small half-block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the light sources are blocked behind the slender figure. Anne Sefir's body was immersed in the backlight, spread her arms, and blocked all the threats for Jenny and the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, I will protect you." Anne's smile is beautiful, it is hard to imagine the pain that should have been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an unknown magic on her arm that attracted all the shrapnel and steel nails. The steel nail pierces her back and arms and can hear the sound of the brush. The blood drips out and drops on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sefer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is facing the blood, moving forward Two steps. At this time, I did not know which piece of goods caused the second explosion, and the violent explosion collapsed the entire building. Broken bricks and tiles smashed on him and he fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's enough." In the smoke, Yanika's smile is equally dazzling. "Sorry, Soledon. You should wake up. The war is not over yet."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s burning blue light on her right hand, straight on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next future is an empty darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha...ha...ha... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door? Soleton gasped fiercely and slammed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered all. Renee and his last scene are not dreams, the reality that happened not long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that morning, he chased the figure of 黛尼卡, passed the transmission point of Jena, and returned to Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a terrible defeat waiting for him there. The soldiers outside the transfer point were all deceived by Renee, and she actually moved gunpowder and fire sol in just a few minutes. Naimen did not know whether there was any credit from the spies of the Royal Security Department. From the point of view of common sense, there should be some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lennie’s transmission point was turned into ashes in the storm, and the small building used as a shelter collapsed, and the flames swept everything on the record. Data, the resistance that has just been traced from the anchor point is almost buried inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Seneca, he would probably die there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way as in Dreamland, Seneca dragged him out of the ruins and interrupted his consciousness with a dizzy magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this? When is it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton muttered to himself Looking out the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a darkness outside the window, only a few dawns appear on the horizon. More bright than those of Xiaoguang, it is a cannonball that drags the light. The light of the magical gun shines on the ring-shaped wall in the distance, and there are towering warning towers and small bastions on the wall. The city of five ring-shaped city walls, here is Lenny, his hometown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war certainly does not end. The familiar shelling sounds through the sky, and the sounds are intertwined, just like the regular alarm clock every morning. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can hear the six-pound infantry and the nine-pound magic cane, can recognize the sullen roar of twenty-four pounds of cannons and cannons, can recall The thunder and thunder of the 72-pound siege cannon. The guns of the emperor sounded a bit sharper, and the guns of the Freedom Army were more stable, showing the subtle differences in the art of gun casting. He could even hear the unique "嘶嘶" sound of the Imperial Magic Rocket. In Kengal, in Jena Blenheim, this weapon symbolizes the strongest elite of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around, the windows around him were clean, and the neat white beds and white sheets were all describing the environment. Even in the artillery, you can hear the sound of hymns. His uniform and calendar are on the table at the bedside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is August 8th... Have I been in a coma for a day? Fortunately, here is Lenny, it’s not too bad to go to chase Nika now. Later, she wouldn’t think that a military uniform could be mixed out of Lenny’s city. How did she get a full set of passwords and passes? No, maybe she’s already caught. Maybe I have to find a way. It’s really troublesome.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be only one patient in the entire ward. A man dressed in a military priest was leaning on a chair by the far door, his head low and a slight squeak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the cathedral of the medical goddess Fortila?" Namimen slightly raised his voice and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, no, it’s the headquarters of the General Command..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, respected priests...hey, hello?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the door to finish, the priest has ran into the hallway and pushed Opened another door: "Reporting Chief! Captain Soledon has woken up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Wake up? According to the Marshal, all the collection!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Guards, get up! Give you five minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Army Music! Military Music! This scene is going to be transferred to the whole of Lenny. It’s all spiritual!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is listening to the mess in the hallway, probably guessing them. What are being prepared. Five minutes later, all the sounds outside the door were at the same time silent - and the melodious sound of the trumpet sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged man wearing a rank of Major General cleanly opened the door and walked into the room with a military step. More martial artists followed him. The back came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tenmen? Captain Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Belongs." Straight up, hold the bed, and want to get up. He knew that this was not the time to ask "What is going on?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to stand up, hero." The Major General reached out and held him down. "I am the seventh 'big sword' National Guard division commander, McCash The general was the defense leader of the Lenny Central Defense Area yesterday. Your heroic performance yesterday saved the Lenny transfer point, saved me, saved my troops, saved the Free Army, saved Lenny, and saved the Republics. Before the official ceremony begins, please let me express my personal gratitude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Major General - although only the Major General of the National Guard - respectfully Respectfully bowed to him. The door is tightly stretched to the nerves of the face, so that the bottom of my heart is not reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on? He has no memory at all. No matter how much he remembers, before he passed out, there was only a few minutes of defeating the battle: the smashed Lonnie transmission point, the dilemma of being completely defeated by 黛尼卡, and even the helplessness rescued by the enemy. In contrast, the lack of logical dreams is a bit clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general will raise his head and wave his hand: "Military band, play music!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;national anthem Reverberate. The generals cleared the scorpion, took out a piece of paper, and began to read the above text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We all know that this war of defending freedom has reached its most critical juncture. In Jena, in Blenheim, we have all achieved brilliant Victory. In order to reverse the situation, the emperor's servants have no choice but to attack our great capital, Lenni. If they can't take Lenny, the whole emperor will become history here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magic officer set up a few magic items around him, preparing for the process of recording and transferring the ceremony. The uneasiness in the door is getting heavier and heavier: the ceremony seems too formal. He originally thought that this was just a consolation prize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we have issued an emergency call, all the vacation, shift, reserve, retired, free army officers and even volunteer militiamen come On the wall, they have no chance. In this case, the emperor's servants can only use the most insidious conspiracy to carry out the most daring adventure to reverse the desperate situation."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was in a coma, has an emergency call has been made? It seems that the battle of Lenny is much more intense than in the previous two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just yesterday, on the morning of August 7, 1676, a group of dirty and treacherous empire agents mixed into our Lennyy City transfer point. Trying to get the coordinates and password of the Lenny's city transfer point. They assassinated our guards, captured our transfer points, and obtained the transfer password and coordinates. Just in the eyes of their conspiracy, the Imperial Guards will When you are passing through the transmission matrix -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the major general talking about? The door is very certain, and it is impossible for Junica to get the full set of data from the Lenny positioning point. It is one thing to go to Lennie from the Jena start-up point that has adjusted the distance, direction and coordinates; it is quite different from transferring to one of the empire's all-points. The difference in difficulty between the two is as large as the igniting of the artillery of the artillery and the commanding artillery hit a moving target three hundred meters away. If the Imperial spies can get the whole set of positioning data scattered in the hands of five people, they have already gotten it, and there is no need to carry out any insidious conspiracy and bold adventure. The ability to blow off the Lenny positioning point is already the limit of the Royal Security Agent. Spy work is by no means omnipotent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General McCash continued to read this article affectionately, not forgetting to pause occasionally, hanging the appetite of the audience. The door end struggled to stretch his lips and recall what he had done. No matter how you remember, the answer seems to be "nothing to do." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the face of the fierce attack of the Royal Security Agent, the captain did not lose his calm. He organized the surviving guards, blocking the enemy's crazy attacks, and In the aftermath of the battle, gunpowder and fire sols were collected for the emergency. In the cruel battle, the people around him fell one after another, leaving him and his adjutant. The captain knew that the time was up. In order to protect the important transmission points, he ignited the lead of the explosives. Everyone knows that this choice is tantamount to suicide; but he still chose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Resist the door and force yourself to look at it. It hurts. If this is not a dream, it is that he has lost his memory. No matter how you remember, there is only a fiasco in the memory, the sea of ​​fire, and the friendly but chilly smile of 黛妮卡. He has never done anything like "blocking the enemy from attacking". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He succeeded. My army and I noticed the explosion and rushed over. Although it was late, we eliminated all the Imperial invaders. But I won't say that we have something worth mentioning - without the bloody battle and sacrifice of Captain Soledon, what we do will have no meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Major General McCash is not like acting, his feelings seem to be really sincere. However, the door is asking yourself, have you really done these things? When did you do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we cleaned up the wreckage of the anchorage, miraculously found the still-lived captain and his adjutant under the ruins. At that moment, I really I feel that the gods are indeed blessing us and blessing all heroic people. There are always things in this world that will make us feel their grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking at the feelings of the generals and the surrounding soldiers, the door does not dare to raise objections. The battle of Lenny's siege has reached the most critical moment, and the morale of the defenders is the key to the key. The Free Army will not allow anyone to question their heroes, even if this person is a hero himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Free Army thank you for your heroic battle and extraordinary performance, Captain. It is your hard work and self-sacrifice that defeats the empire's conspiracy and saves Lenny. You wisely blow up the transported array that has been leaked, completely eliminating the possibility of the emperor further invading through this transfer point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general will roll up The paper roll was put back in the box. Resist the door and glance at the box, scared to stand up straight: there is a medal in the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A medal that is too big to be true. The surface of pure gold is inlaid with dozens of colorful gemstones, which are connected by a bright silver and fuchsia wire magic loop. That should not be--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the name of the Lenny Joint Parliament authorized by the republics, the Free Army-Free Navy established as a joint parliamentary license Representative, I will present this Medal of Excellence to you, Captain Soleton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait - The door wants to say that. Things came too fast, too direct, too gorgeous, and he didn't know what went wrong. Is it another dream? Medal of Excellence? This joke is a bit too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the highest honor of the Free Army. Four out of every five outstanding medals of honor were issued to the dead. With the magic effect attached above, it is not necessarily possible to copy with 200,000 gold pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--I can't accept this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stand up straight, Shangyu!" The general screamed and interrupted him. "All have!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the ceremonial soldiers stand straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the savior of Lenny, salute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is full of discouragement, blocking Lived all the words of the door. The national anthem sounded through the sound reinforcement array and echoed over Lenny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long live, our free motherland, it is built from the hands of the people! May the gods bless them to unite and freedom, and wish the four-color cross flag to fly for a long time!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
