			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottle burst open and the good white wine cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the boy is too late to worry about the wasted wine, he is now worried about his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirate who once ranked the eighth in the open sea, and now has "reformed the evil spirits" wiped the wine and broken glass on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his lips and had blood flowing from his lips. Indeed, this sentence is generally used to describe people who are dying, but the lips can be cut by broken glass to have the same effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This wine tastes good. This glass slag tastes good too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katzmi of the chain breastplate; Stewart laughed a few times in the sky, and there was no trace of any change in the laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The taste of blood, of course, is no better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Former pirate captain's face A brave expression emerged. There was no blood on his face, and it was a little scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can even see the anger in his eyes, the two eyes are as sharp as a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knife!" A break from the mouth of Kazimi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds off, immediately scared all the clerk around, and at least half of the pirates on the ground. Next to his former subordinates, he ran to the shelf and gave him the "Ming knife cut". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to stop. Katzmi took the knife and quietly pulled out the knife. The faint glow of the magic candle shines on the blade, and its waves are like water. He slammed his finger on the blade and made a "beep" tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tremor is like an invisible command, and the whole store instantly becomes dead. Upon seeing it, the boy involuntarily retracted his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if the wind is too sloppy, the knife will leave a wound on the wind, so the name is eager."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi stepped forward and pointed the knife away. His smile is reflected in the knife, a little embarrassing. The former pirate's finger stained some blood on his mouth and slowly rubbed it on the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This knife is out, it is necessary to see blood. Unfortunately, I have no more blood to water its edge."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade is bloody, and with the shaking of the candlelight, it becomes a flash of red. He moved forward two steps, lifting the knife to the waist. Clade; Lopez and Nenmen; Fran's black robe man glanced at him, his eyes full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Incorrect shooting, or not accidental shooting, this is a problem. But I don't care, I don't want to listen to regrets. For pirates, wine is Second life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi stepped forward in three steps, with a front bow and a bow, ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"风翔剑!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kezmi slammed and slammed forward And out. The blade was stable and there was no tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the sword was coming out, Sorley felt a bit of coolness, and it seemed that there was a wind blowing in front of him. He fixed his eyes and found that the indestructible candle on the table in front of him was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four candles are actually at the same height, and the incisions are almost the same! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coolness he felt instantly turned into a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good magic sword." Clad slowly stood up and the door was bounced from the seat. Although the other party's imposing opening left a deep impression on them, neither of them was a person who would retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We really feel sorry for the accident. We are willing to take responsibility." Lieutenant said slowly and word by word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just?" Clade is not humble. "Then we can compensate you for your loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compensation?" It seems to be something that is very funny, ex-pirate Sneer. "Compensate for the second life of pirates? What's more, how do I know that you don't want to count me? According to the rules of pirates, this kind of calculation is determined by a duel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Duel?" Hearing the word, the poor, sinister teenager was scared to huddle in the corner. "With this kind of desperate? Isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duress..." Also heard the word, the expression on the face of middle-aged soldiers has not changed. . This is a small scene for him who has been wandering all the year round and has been fighting for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, your nuns are really comfortable, Bonnie." Reza wears slowly in the temporary locker room that completely blocks the sound and voyeurs. On the golden robe, satisfied with the authentic. "The clothes that are used for swimming look very comfortable, and they are much better than swimming in a bathrobe. But will the swimsuit be too exposed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, because it is a sacred costume that is blessed by the gods, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth is very serious, Bonnie is secret in his heart Apologize to your faith. In this era, she is the most powerful Protestant pastor... Hey, then what should be said is right, she thought. Fortunately, it is a one-piece swimsuit, not a bikini. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, that’s fine. Let’s find a place to open a shop nearby.” The alchemist remodeled the temporary dressing room into an ordinary wall. "Let's continue to drink..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she saw the two sides who were arrogant. For a time, Reza felt a bit embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come again...? Last time in Rama...this guy is fighting with people? Leonard!" Shouted the name of the half elf, but did not get a response. She was a little annoyed and was about to continue to shout. One of them pulled her robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Kaikawi seems to have drunk too much, and it is useless to call him." Bonnie’s face was filled with a strong smile and pointed to her finger. Their table. The former St. Sennhai at the table is pouring a glass of wine into the mouth, as if to know nothing about the tensions not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did this get done?" Reza's eyebrows twisted into a ball and hurried away. "Did he not drink almost alcohol before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About all thanks to your elbow..." Bonnie thought, but she didn't want to This is the case - it is too much trouble to modify the memory. Seeing that Teresa tried very hard to lift the half-elf's pointed ears and screamed inside, Bonnie had no choice but to continue to control the two of them. For her, there is now an important and much more important thing to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister? Are you still awake?" The girl sat down with some worry about her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She noticed that Anne still bowed her head, hands clasped meaninglessly, changing various gestures, and the appearance seemed to be completely thinking about love. Female middle school student with questions. She hesitated and gently pulled her sister's hands away; Anne's hand was a little cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s awake." Anne’s throat trembled and a very weak voice came out. “I’m always awake.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to stop them?" Bonnie whispered in her ear. "Only you are qualified to make this decision. This thing is definitely not in the original history." It should happen. You can destroy it and let history maintain its original track; or you can choose to get to know the door; Fran..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... don't want to. Wait a second, I want to observe more." Anne hesitated. "I really want to know if this person is 'that person.' This may be a chance..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right." Bonnie nodded lightly. She swept the two people over there again: the half-elves might have really drunk too much, and they wanted to fall on the thighs of Reza. The alchemist shook his body with some irritability, removed his leg a little, and only let his head lean against her knees, continuing the hopeless effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But both of them feel that this joke is not very funny, especially now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big pirates who have traveled across the sea, and the generals who traveled to Kyushu, are squatting in the middle of the lobby of the "Xi Zhao". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is full of fierce murderousness, and seems to be able to shoot at any time; the latter is cold and can not see any threatening appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, Mr. Pirate, you don’t have to make a fool of it. What do you want? The Orientals always say that they must first draw a path on the ground before they can continue negotiations. Lieutenant Lieutenant said, "It’s just a bullet hitting the bottle. Shouldn’t you use a duel?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking He intentionally or unintentionally geography the neckline, just like emphasizing his collar and epaulettes. Temporary lieutenant. The provincial council directly governs the troops. The first step in the negotiations is to bid and reveal the reserve price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, I think so too. After all, I have not done pirates, and I have changed my mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Kazmi grinned, with a sigh of anger in his smile. He pressed the handle and let the blade decorated with red silk appear slightly in the sheath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad’s squatting on his military uniform, revealing his belt, a sheathed dagger on his belt, and two A small box of ammunition and gunpowder. There are four-color cross coats on the sheath of the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the dagger and took the dagger and said: "Is it? It’s good to change the evil spirits... but I am blunt, you are not like the way you changed your mind." "", ah, no matter what, it has changed its evil spirits, it is not good to fight with people again." Katzmi smirked, "Speak up, After changing the evil spirits, I was a little tight at hand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Lopez and the Fran, who had come over, looked at each other and both of them breathed a sigh of relief A consensus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original imposing guy really wants to be cunning...but, since it is money, it’s easy to do. After understanding the true purpose of the other party, the general was relieved a lot. Reserve price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said in a deep voice, "Today is a very important day for me. I don't want to conflict with a guy like you. Offer it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The former pirate did not hesitate to point to the teenager who was curled up in a corner. "I want that to count my pistol."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad; Lopez's eyebrows tremble: "I can give you money."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just need that gun." Kazmi smiled. "Your gun, it looks like there is only one barrel, but it can be fired more than once. My ears are very Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't work." Lopez said first, his eyes seemed to be looking into the distance. "Open the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are also going to give it to others anyway," Kazmi said. The reason why he decided to stir up the incident was to get the gun. A pistol that can be fired multiple times is very meaningful to a pirate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Clade; Lopez seems to have considered it for a long time before responding. "You who are deceiving others are not worthy of these two guns. The two guns belong to Luo Ruide. The words for you are a betrayal of my past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear the last word mentioned by Lieutenant General, Kazmi; Stefanhaus’s smile suddenly freezes. The former pirates who had been watching the lively night heard the word and also retreated. They all know that Kazmi hates two things most: personal attacks and betrayal. Although this person often betrayed himself, he hates the word "betrayal". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that ... the bid can only be like this, and some people think they are very smart. The deal, fifty pounds..." The former pirate captain light The embossing on the shank, "...add a little to find the head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered the keyword that activated the special effect of the samurai sword: “Wind cut! Wind injury is a knife!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead pirates!" I didn't expect the negotiations to burst so quickly and without warning. Leisha hurriedly threw away the half-elf body and stood up to try to stop their fight. "If you kill the general, even I will be hurt! Ganda!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can this be?! It will not ask me to resurrect history. "Is the important person?" Bonnie was also shocked. "Klad; Lopez is just a three-legged cat mage, even if he is experienced..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is about to Get up and stop Katzmi with magic, and Annie took her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the blonde girl blinked. "I am using magical exploration to see the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic detection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just now, my eyes were shaken. Sometimes the history book can't be fully believed." Anne quietly began to prepare a magic. "I originally thought of Klad; Lopez should be strong."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear on Bonnie's face faded a little: "Are you no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem. I understand that as long as We can continue to collect information, and we can understand the truth." Anne; Sefer re-emerged, stood up, walked to the half-elf, and took a picture on his back. The pale yellow light flashed on Leonard's body. "Or stop this battle first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop the fight? Then why do you use fatigue for him?" Bonnie raised her eyebrows strangely. "Do you really have no problem, sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha? Weary surgery? Isn't it hangover?" Annie hurriedly lowered her head and found her side The man’s is a mess. "Yeah!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The light of hangover is light green, sister! You are not suitable for magic that you are not familiar with now!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another mess here. During this time, the battle over there has intensified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind cuts just a broken sheath, and there is a sudden flash of light in Clade’s eyes. He used the other thing he learned in the East: "Heart of Mind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the view of the juvenile, his fighting action is like cheating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the holder of the recurve knife was swift and violent, Clade had already placed his dagger there early before his sword was attacked. With only a very light movement, Klad resolved the knife that must win. He slammed forward and left his hand on Kazmi's arm; Captain Stewart only felt a numb wrist, and the knife fell directly to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could it be...! The wind has never been a slap in the face..." Katzmi’s face was full of stunned look. Since the last defeat, he has decided to use the strongest meaning he has in each shot; but he still loses. He lost very unwillingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sickle technique is really strong, but the disadvantage is that there is no backhand. The Eastern warrior will not give the other party as long as the first knife of the sickle is broken. The opportunity to have a second knife." Luo Ruide, who had faced the sickle technique, said leisurely, he said these words in Eastern languages. Katzmi couldn't understand Oriental, but he could understand the word "sickle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the sickle?" Kazmi asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't understand Oriental?" The middle-aged man stunned and returned to Clade; Lopez's mother tongue. "Then your scythe is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing, Kazmi! Ganda!" At this time, Reza finally rushed over. Angrily shouting at his own voice, "Give me this guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge golden golem rushed forward. The alchemist's original meaning is "dead pirates"; but the generals who have been war-torn will not think so. Clade; Lopez picked a foot and kicked the samurai sword on the ground far away, and then jumped back two steps, holding the dagger sheath tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you a group?!" He was a little surprised. One is surprised that the pirate was just a group with this blonde, and the second was surprised that this blonde is the real master of the giant statue. Out of the habit of long-term in the East, he immediately began to recalculate the strength of the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant's forehead secreted a slight sweat and quietly clenched his dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break the dream!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to preemptively than to get into a desperate situation - this is his presence in the East The principles of action learned. In the unscrupulous environment of the East, which is superficial and private, it is impossible to survive without doing so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when he evoked the name of Feijian, in the gray vision of Anne, there suddenly appeared a bright and dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light is emitted from the head of the dagger in the hand; no need to recall the standard aura light meter, Anne knows the magic strength expressed. Under the radiance of the light, Kazmi's Ming knife, Leisha's scepter, half-elf fine sword, and even the golden devil like Ganda, are dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artifact, or cursed weapon. In this era, Anne can only think of these two possibilities. No matter which one, unprepared Reza can't handle it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crader; Lopez... Was this person so ruthless? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Never let Clade shoot! Use magic to resist him, Mai Li! Otherwise we will have big trouble!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne seems to have regained her ability to think, stand up and just drop this sentence to her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Bonnie stunned and immediately understood that she had also covered a layer of magical exploration in front of her eyes. She was also taken aback when she saw the aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without thinking, as a counter-anti-expert, she did not hesitate to throw a universal anti-magic magic: "Breaking the Magic!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic can block the effects of almost all magic and magic items - if the user is strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad is about to shoot the flying sword, but suddenly feels that the sword in his hand is suddenly stagnation, and he can’t get out. The magic that did not have any warnings quietly hugged him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reverse magic?!" He was shocked. Accustomed to the confrontation of the East only stressing power, he almost forgot the magical confrontation method that emphasizes skill and timing in his hometown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tentatively made the broken dreams struggle. The power of this counter-magic is so strong that it can suppress the weapons connected to his soul...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Is this female mage? Or the half elf in that corner? he does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one thing is certain: it is not strong enough to completely prevent him from acting. If the other party has such a master, he must preempt his own secret weapon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break the Dream; Fairy Strike!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of Luo Ruide, he liberated himself The sword has all the abilities. For a moment, the light blue light crossed the scabbard and appeared in front of everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Sefer now knows that he really is looking down on this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical light emitted by the artifact was only slightly stunned by Bonnie’s broken magic, and it was re-lighted, even more blazing than before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul Connect!" She understood. This highly dangerous magical item is too dependent to be used by anyone after more than two hundred years - but that does not mean that the technology is not powerful enough. The reason why no one wants to use it is just that "the soul connection is too costly and not worth it." In later generations, there are many other ways to achieve the same power, and it is impossible to use such a dangerous method that will lead to schizophrenia at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bonnie can't stop the soul-connected items... even if I add it, I can't do it. What should I do?!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blocking? If the attack of the thing is forcibly blocked, the real power of her and her sister will be exposed again - in this glass-walled restaurant, it is difficult to catch everyone around to tamper with the memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
