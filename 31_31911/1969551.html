			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Calendar March 20, 1665, North East Coast, North West Coast, Human Colony Center, New Delhi, southeast wind, southwest wind<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of the day appeared at 6 o'clock in the morning, and the last line of sunset ended at 18 o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the day is equal to the length of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning of the day, the southeast wind was still covered with New Derania; on the afternoon of that day, the southwest wind began to blow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people call that day called the spring equinox, and the wind that came to the north temperate zone that day was called the trade wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun on the vernal equinox has already crossed the noon. The caravan going to the Western Barbarian tribe is about to depart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wind is blowing. It’s the season to do business, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spring breeze gently twirled the golden hair of the speaker, allowing her soft golden hair to stretch completely in the free trade wind, as if pouring down the sun. Her voice is crisp and sweet, with the fragrance of hyacinth grass; the coldness of the mouth that always changes, makes her appear to be inconsistent with other people in the caravan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low and fuzzy voices linger from the throat of her guard Out, with all his loyalty. His body is tall and muscular, and his muscles are exceptionally strong. I am afraid that only the strongest trolls or barbarians can compare with him. If you consider his heavy, golden body armor, which is very heavy and wrapped all over the body, even the best fighters will shun in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her property is her guard, and a cart full of cargo. However, there is only a big car - there is no horse to pull the car, which makes her just joined the caravan she is very independent. However, there are more reasons why people don't want to approach her: that is her dress. In addition to the natural golden waist and long hair, her whole body decorations are golden. She wore a gold necklace on her neck, six gold rings on her fingers, a golden cloak on her back, and a gold robe on her body. Coupled with the guards of Jin Hao around, people can see the golden light shining on her body in hundreds of steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like you can shake off the gold powder at any time." "Is it completely a nouveau riche?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard such a rumor, the blonde woman is only a cold smile, not at all in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Excuse me, do you want a horse? Our team is a bit redundant and can be sold to you at a cheap price..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one kind of person will go close to the upstarts - the horse dealers will see that she has no horses, and naturally she will go close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have my own way of pulling the car." Upon hearing the inquiry, the woman raised her hand indifferently and patted the waist of the tall guard around her. "Ganda, you can be fully competent, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Still the low voice that emerged from the depths of the throat. It seems to prove that he immediately grabbed the yoke and pulled the car forward; the wheel left a deep rut on the mud, proving that the load inside the car was quite light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Ganda, don't have to go on, the caravan hasn't set off yet." The whip in the blonde woman's hand slammed, indicating that her guard had stopped. "Thank you for your kindness, I don't think I need a horse here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if she doesn't say this, the horse dealers will not be with her again. Doing this business; all of them have been shrouded in chills, as if the temperature of the surrounding air suddenly dropped by five degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... is there a real person? Isn't it a magical creature or an undead?" Someone dared to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde woman just smiled indifferently: "He is very understanding? You guys, it’s time to explain what others mean."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sentence, the horse dealers fled in the cold field of this woman in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New rumors began to spread in the caravans. From that day on, the fear of this woman, or the queen, was deeply implanted in the hearts of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumored heroine still smiles faintly, completely ignoring the curiosity and fear of others. She rushed her car and walked alone in the middle of the caravan, seemingly satisfied with the situation that no one dared to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Toscaville, there are 20 days away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Calendar April 14, 1665 Tosca Prairie Clear Sky<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caravan "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people of the entire tribe are running around and the news is being transmitted to the distance with the nomadic cattle and hunters. The news began to spread from the caravan a week ago and has been circulating until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this inland area, the arrival of caravans is definitely a big deal. People in the distant tribes will ride horses or lizards, furs, and exchange for the supplies necessary for life. The wealthy chiefs are rushing their cattle and flocks, from their own tribes to the market where the caravans are located - Toscaville, which means "the grassland center" in the tribal language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here to the seaside colonial town, it takes about 10 days for the horse to gallop - the universal distance unit converted into later generations is 800 kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 150 years, "Toscaville" will become a famous center of heavy industry, the focus of the East and West Army in the Beixinzhou Civil War, at least two The main stage of ten war novels and fifty romance novels; but in this era, it is only a tribal seasonal settlement. Usually there are few Tosca or white people living here, and only when the caravan comes, Toscaville will be busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White caravans will come once every two quarters from the East Coast. Eight hundred kilometers on the road, there are many tribal and ethnic settlements, many of whom are bad. If you can't get enough people and muskets, no one dares to go on the road. A typical caravan will carry everything from food seasoning, daily necessities to weapons armor - all of which are incompetent in the inland grasslands and even the entire New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants who arrived here quickly put down the big cart, set aside the stalls, and started selling. The hundreds of guards they hired went to the nearby tribes with open styles, holding the little gadgets and trinkets, and looking for some barbarian girls to spend the good nights - of course, every time there were some The unlucky egg was caught. Ever since discovering that these whites like the openness of the tribe, the chiefs of the tribe have added a new family rule that “prohibits the destruction of the tribal style” in order to light up the rare objects of these whites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these little things never affect the normal trading in the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oil, what is the value?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four furs!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants piled up their smiles diligently, erecting four fingers, in case the patrons of the less intelligent head were miscalculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about this sword?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three five furs!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman’s left hand and five fingers open, flip, and flip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"要要!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong barbarian, from inside the sack, 甩Five coats of skin, one foot and one square, plus a whole piece of sheepskin, thrown in the ground, pick up the sword and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People on the grassland use "five" as the basic unit of measurement, using various sizes of cut-and-cut fur as currency. The whole piece of fur is placed inside the box, which is convenient to take, and it is easy to settle. Unless there is a big sale, they use the whole payment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nomads have not produced much, and their lives are made up of grazing, hunting, and plundering. Day after day, year after year, they live the same life for generations, making generations of pioneers become rich. They don't want to change, they don't want to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you have to fight?" The people of the caravan are uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian wants to fight, and only goes in one direction - the west. In the west, there is another huge backward civilization, the dwarf civilization. These two groups are feuding, and they are fighting almost every month. Rumors like "the dwarf will attack Toscaville" are circulated everywhere on the prairie, and the object of the rumor is constantly changing. This fear is not unreasonable: the territories inhabited by the tribes in the west have turned into dwarf farmland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get the goods out as soon as possible, the merchants offered a lower price than ever before. Hurry and sell things, earn some and leave, don't be too greedy. If you are involved in the scuffles of these tribes, you will not be able to enjoy your wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is the afternoon of the fifth day, almost all the big cars are empty, and put on a very heavy fur. The merchants happily counted the fur, basking in the warm sunshine of the spring grasslands, and exchanged information about how much they earned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have earned 300 pieces of fur. What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, don't mention Only one hundred and fifty, the price cut has dropped too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not bad, can sell. The one over there is golden A woman, asking for a price is too high, but a piece of fur is not earned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking down the direction of the merchants, it is a big car. The other people's big cars have almost been sold out, carrying the earned fur, the stowage has been much lighter; only the rut of this big car is still as deep as when it came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the cart is in the driver's position of the car, his face is covered with a wide-brimmed hat that the cowboy often covers, reclining Snoring. Even if she is snoring, her mouth is still hung with some kind of arrogant indifference. Gold necklaces, gold rings, gold cloaks, golden robes, and even intimate underwear seem to be golden. Even after twenty days of servant, she still shines in gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why a business has not been sold, part of the reason is her escort - see this big man, the average barbarian will be scared away; dare When I asked the price, I basically ran off when I asked the price. However, that is only a secondary reason, the main reason is still on the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not sell, not price, you decide how much, I decided not to sell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Regardless of who asked, the hostess of the goods had only such a cold answer, and she still ignored it. Occasionally, several people tried to mention the high price of a hundred pieces of fur, and they were driven away by her indifference, ridicule, and disdainful eyes. Even after the last day, she was not in a hurry; others began to sell at a discount, but she was lying in the car and sleeping comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can make money, there is no reason for it - the businessmen of the same team are so asserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you sell these things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, someone came here Her booth. It was a red-skinned man with a bold smile on his face, a muscular and strong Tosca man, and he was followed by two tall and strong friends like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two hundred bottles of therapeutic syrup. Not for sale, not for two, you decide how much, I decided not to sell."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She removed the hat on her face and glanced at the three savage, answering as lazy as usual. "There are two hundred flaming rubbers, two hundred elves burning water..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I bought it." This person said a good Koman , or the standard Delan cavity. "7,500 pieces of fur. 3,000 pieces of wolf skin, 3,000 pieces of sheepskin, 1,500 pieces of giant lizard, all paid in whole, first class."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hostess of the goods stood up in surprise and looked at the people who were bidding in front of them. It was a tall, burly red-skinned barbarian with a strong muscle. He does not use the "five" as a unit of measurement, and it is obviously educated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7,500 pieces? Do you pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, seven Thousands and 500 pieces. I paid." The barbarian grinned. He is certainly not handsome, but has a special wild charm. It is not the roughness of other barbarians, it is an unrestrained wildness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
