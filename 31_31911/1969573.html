			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the taxi driver is very respectful, probably because of her magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't look for it." She woke up from her memories, dropped her money, and walked out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before her is her destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coleman Union University Arcane Magic Academy is quietly lying on the Blue Loquat Hill, its large and quaint building complex along the hills. The southeast is tiled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the average university, the adjective "squeaky" is absolutely impossible to use on buildings - but the Coleman Union University Arcane Magic Academy Does not match this sentence. The colorful buildings of the college have become famous attractions in the neutral city of DeLand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the tower of the Destiny Magic Research Department in the northeast corner is a blue icosahedron floating in the air, with numbers on each side. In addition, it will be transferred every day, and this bonus (or depreciation) will be used to correct many things and scores within the department. It is said that at least 50 students are trying to influence the rotation of the building in various ways every day, but no exact and effective method has been found yet. The architect's anti-magic has indeed done quite well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hermont Multi-Laboratory, located at the foot of the foot of the mountain, has a huge birdcage-enhanced crystal vault that can be set to transmit light and partially Light or opaque, the experimenter is provided with a variety of conditions - unfortunately in order to save costs, the roof can not be opened, otherwise it can be used as a stadium. This Hermonte laboratory is said to have the highest rate of damage due to ample budget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summons and contract magic department has no department, all the students are in a super-large high-level demon hard corpse, so that they can deeply remember the loopholes The consequences of the contract. This legend is summoned by the great magicians of the Age of Enlightenment when they studied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several legendary buildings in the college, such as the Exotic Department of Magic and the Department of Geography, which are only on average every two or three years. Once in the college, it is said that enrollment is only two or three years; the office building of the Space Change Technology Department is said to be always inside the college, but no one except the professor of the department knows which one is now folded on campus. corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current principal is a standing committee member of the Standing Committee of the Magic Arbitration Association. He studies gravity and anti-gravity techniques, so his office always flies over the college. There are rumors that "multiple turret story" is what he invested in, but I don't know if it is true or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every building has its own uniqueness, with the exception of one building. The building is a quaint bluestone tower hidden among the highest points of the top of the Lanotetia hill, overlooking all the buildings below the hills. The history of this bluestone tower is longer than the history of any building in the college. In the long, long, long time, it is known as the "supreme magic tower". Until it was no longer in that mission, it could be revealed that after the day, people built the University of Koman Empire on the Blue Lottia Hill at its feet. After the end of the civil war, the University of Koman was also transformed into the University of Coman Union with the change of the name of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, this Bluestone Tower remains one of the most important buildings in the college. Its current name is called "The Tower of Defense." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She climbed up the steps along the Bluestone Steps and headed for the top of the Blue Loquat. Seeing her arrival, all the protective magic near the tower of the defense was removed to welcome the protagonist of today's defense. More than a hundred observers have been sitting in the lobby of the reply tower, but they have not made a sound, just waiting quietly for the protagonist to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stayed in the middle of the ladder and showed the magic badge. The surrounding trees spread out automatically, leaving an open space in which an east-style pavilion is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here you can overlook the entire free city of DeLand. She walked into the empty pavilion, sat down on the stone bench and looked down. There is no cloud above the city today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still the names of Upper DeLand, Lower DeLand, and New DeLand, but they are no longer affiliated with different countries. The metropolis that was once artificially divided into four blocks has been reunified under the name of “neutrality”. Now, it has once again become the capital of the Coman Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hand leaned against her cheek and whispered with a faint smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no war. It is the result of all of us working together. Are you satisfied with this result?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone else sees her now, I might be surprised. As one of the best magicians in the world, she even talks to the air like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, I am afraid you will not feel very happy. You are not only love Coleman, but also love human beings, you love all this world. Wisdom of life. When you find yourself on the wrong path, you will not hesitate to change yourself. If the position determines your head, you would rather give up your position to achieve your goal."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said faintly, as if he still lives by her side, in her body. This habit was developed ten years ago and has not changed until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Others say that you are a war madman, a gambler who gets everything and loses everything in the war. But I know that you are actually a hate war People. If you know that your power will run out, why not say it earlier? Or do you not want to stay in this world again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here Looking around, you can see the faint light of the global magic net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? After you left, the global magic net you dreamed of has been built. Now, the wizards and pastors have no need to prepare the magic. They can always get magic from the global magic net and use it with their own strength. We also explore the outer plane and other boundaries. Some are like the other side of the world, we have gotten with a few souls inside. Communication. However, I am afraid you will not be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are there, at least she may get the address. But you are not anywhere, as if you have never been to this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you have been there. The evidence you have been here has been left in every corner of our world."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up, and there were planes and airships in the air cut through the sky with trails. The cost of anti-gravity technology and jet propulsion technology has been reduced, and there are some sporadic "airborne flying vehicles" and "airborne armored warships" and other things are cruising, and there is also a floating city built there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And my heart. You will always be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss; Kui Rashih smiled and quietly stepped out to the culmination of magic science. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Response begins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please explain the difference between your implementation mechanism and the traditional implementation mechanism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Simply put, now In some magic systems, there are three kinds of magic as the "Wish of Wishing" system: limited wishing, wishing, and over-recognition. These three magics are similar in name and similar in performance, but after experimentation. Make sure that their mechanism is completely different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is standing in the center of the defense meeting room, the projector hit the title of this reply on the blackboard behind me: "Using magical amplification technology to realize the idea of ​​materialization." Since the invention of the projector, basically no illusion is used to create visual effects, which also saves the defense process a lot. In the early days, in order to supplement the effectiveness of illusion, a reply often delayed for three days, five days or even ten days - the historical record is seventeen days, and the respondent is particularly not good at illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Limited Wishing can be thought of as an 'imitation' spell. The effects it achieves are basically existing magic effects, the advantage is It can imitate spells with different principles and power sources. Wishing is a kind of 'swap' spell, in fact it should be the magic of the principle of the priest 'miracle', so there will be many misinterpreted results when the wish is realized. But 'Over-limit wishing' is a magic of 'ideal materialization'. With powerful power, directly enlighten the mind in the mind to achieve the original and ultimate magic."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this magic has never been realized. How can you determine the correctness of this theory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face was a little red. This magic is actually not used by no one. At least, she knew that there was a man who had done this magic secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the last question. To what extent is the power of this magic limited?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Close to infinity. The current limit supported by theory should be to create a world. It is based on the parallel world space and time hypothesis. This magic can overcome the unidirectionality of the time axis and create a new copy of the parallel world. In terms of research results, this should be a very difficult thing. Time and space itself is inertia, it will always strive to maintain balance until the balance collapses, has to split a new parallel world. Or use probabilistic cosmology The view that when the probability changes drastically enough to shake all observers, the universe itself will change. As for each change in probability, a view of the cosmic universe will be produced, which is not consistent with the formula of mental entropy conversion. "Not accepted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good assumptions. But we would rather not assume this assumption, because then all of our history may be Crash."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But different historical branches will never interfere with each other. If they can interfere with each other, this theory will not hold."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paradox?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s a paradox, so we don't have to worry about it. So, Is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professors sitting below looked at each other and nodded their heads to indicate the end of the reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Therefore, Reese; Ms. Quillahiya’s Ph.D. thesis on advanced magic theory was passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The warm applause sounded, and all the listeners in the entire hall stood up and paid tribute. The blonde standing on the stage bowed to everyone and began to pack up the mountain of materials and demos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Congratulations, there hasn't been such a historic theoretical paper for a long time. Efforts, young people, maybe you can create a new sub-sect. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will work hard." Reese smiled and perfunctory. She is not very interested in the pioneering faction and the history of science. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the experiment is successful, the Spiritual Mechanics Contribution Award must be yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Maybe." She still smiled and perfunctory, and she didn't have much interest in winning the prize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, is your magic experiment arranged? If it is not arranged, I may be able to help arrange it. I have it in the International League Magic Affairs Department. Friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, but I am negotiating about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is coping Friends, absent-mindedly accepted a doctorate and doctoral cap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you see it? I am not the old one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking around Only warm applause and crowds. In the chaos of all that, she felt the loneliness of the bones. In this scene, she only wants two people to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are not here. Her sister, Melia Yana, should be coming soon, but there is another one...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark curtain around the entire defense tower was pulled off in an instant, warm yellow sunlight Covered on the retina. She blinked her eyes, slightly moist, as if she had entered the ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going down the entrance to the subway, the faint light hits the ladder of black marble texture. The thick zenith covers the head and can't tell the difference between day and night; the busy traffic should be passing over the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the radio out of her carry-on bag and whispered the channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to FM 214.5 MHz. The couple in front of the radio, Happy Valentine's Day! The following song is the most popular sword and magic show recently. Princess's ending song, 'You are my sky'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone on the icy wall of the subway station, she pressed the button of the waist magic recorder and found the full version of the song in the magic net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the play mode to "single", "repeat", so that the sad melodies keep echoing in your ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lit the cigarette, pumping one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has fantasized about the reunion with that person countless times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, it should be in a burning city, that is probably the scene most commensurate with that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, the army rushed back and forth, filled with the cry of women and children and the screams of men. Blood ran on the ground, and the soldiers sang their own battle songs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, cold guns and smashing arrows flew out of the alleys, and mercenaries and thieves with sly smiles kept killing ordinary people and plundering their belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a sword for the image of a lady, a black crossbow on the left arm, and four revolvers on the waist. The outside of the calf is tied with leggings filled with smashing arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is wearing a Kevlar-enhanced bullet-proof composite tight-fitting soft armor that covers all the vital parts; surrounded by a faint blue magical defensive magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in the middle of the city’s biggest road, with a triumphant smile, ruthlessly killing every bad soldier who is harassing civilians, and letting go of discipline soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, came to the front of a huge, burning building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being going inside, behind the scenes, the sound of breaking through the air - at that moment, a magical light shines from the flames inside the building Out, it blocked the dark bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should stand in the middle of the flames and look at her with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, it should be in the territory of a demon or evil sorcerer. Follow the clues of where you don't know, and trace the possible whereabouts of that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a bloody and rancid smell in the air, the dark green body fluid flowing on the ground, the reddish magma flowing quietly in the volcanic rock texture. In the river bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still countless monsters around them. Those who are lying on the ground have no clever mind, but have extremely sharp and sharp claws and teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will quietly stand among these violent creatures ready to go, looking at the creatures that are enough to make the professional soldiers back away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attire can't be like a warrior, but like a white-collar woman on a holiday trip, wearing a light yellow suit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden hair is scattered behind the back, the whole body is just as bathed, smooth, clean and spotless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pistol in his hand, the most powerful pistol, the pistol that can break almost all magical obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing like a noble princess, but not afraid to use his power, with an amazing power, sweeping everything that dares to block the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the last enemy is seen, fight with the evil enemy until you feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding when, I heard a reassuring voice coming from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, the best reunion scene, it’s a bar or a coffee shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a melodious blues or rhythm and blues in the sound, with a colorful cocktail in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender is dressed in a neat dress, and his fingers are flying between the bartenders, and they become a bottle of wine of all countries, and pour it into her. In the wine glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one time, her soft hand couldn't catch the glass that slipped along the bar, and the glass flew back like that--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The position next to her was intercepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jerked back, but saw the man pick up the glass and smiled there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am back. Waiting for a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hopes that one day, she will be able to Meet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hopes that one day she can proudly boast of her current abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hopes that one day, she will go to his side with her own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese looked up from her imaginary thoughts, and the trains of the trains passed by her eyes. The door is open, people are pouring in, the door is closed, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life and life are intertwined, passing by and passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Melly the guy still didn't come? The work is really busy. They are 27 years old. She still doesn't consider looking for a man to contact me? Really let People worry." She grinned helplessly. "I see, the greatest miracle that can be achieved with this magic is not to create a parallel world, but to let our 'Iron Virgin' lady be interested in men - ah, there must be men who dare to associate with her, think I want to have a headache..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but, what about herself? Reese; Quillahia smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is an autobiography...the number of male creatures that have been contacted is zero. If you count undead, the quantity is one..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss; Quillahia is known in the name of “some confused female demon magic experts”, and the followers are almost always wanting to be strong women. Independent young women are also the targets that make the average male look away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crowd of lovers, her figure looks a bit lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are you going? Go there, ok. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made a decision. That place is her own secret. The white light that transmitted the magic flashed, and her figure disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her eyes and felt dizzy. The surrounding air is flowing rapidly, not as calm as on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an island suspended in the air--no, it should be said to be a room suspended in the air. Originally there should be metal retaining walls, but those metals seem to have been rusty. There were also large and small holes scattered between the rusts. She had specially added the guardrails made of wire mesh to those holes. This room is suspended above the city centre of DeLand, as long as the weather is fine, from here you can overlook the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerful magic hides it from the general public. Here, it is the only place where she can quietly recall that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only relic of the magical floating battleship Antig Grove, the powerhouse and suspension room of the battleship. Whether Reese is happy or sad, she will come here to relax. It is always quiet and no one will bother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have used magic once here, I can use it too. What promise do you make? I, what wishes? "She faced the wreckage of the suspension room and muttered to herself. Here, Reese seems to be a person with completely different temperament. It’s not that she is a lazy, confused, reckless; Quillah, but a completely different person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind quietly pushed the clouds above DeLand, and a cloud slowly approached, lingering around the island of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black shadow on her head. The black shadow trail fell straight down, just on her, completely breaking the quiet atmosphere around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Positioning is a bit wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
