			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rental carriage stopped at the roadside filled with dust and dirt in the civilian area. As the second secretary of state of the Syrian Arab Republic, who has the name of "can cure the children's nightingale", Nikola; Machiavelli did not live in the mansion, but chose a small three-story apartment building in the civilian area. Apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you are a politician in a free country, it’s very admirable to do this – Bonnie thinks so, going to the main entrance of the building. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building of the apartment building itself is not old, but at best it is only five or six years old, and it seems to be somewhat different in this city with a long history. It is obvious that there are spell users who live in it - because the water outlets on the sewers of the nearby sewers exude a faint glow of purification magic. From the point that the magical cover was not stolen by greedy people, the defensive ability of this apartment is not as simple as the appearance. The second state secretary has not many private enemies, but the public enemy and political enemies are full of valleys, and I am afraid that they can fill this street - for example, in the Holy Coman Empire, there are several dukes and marquis who want him. Life. The residents of the apartment are probably the same as guards or mercenaries? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since there is no appointment, let me say hello." A smile on her face from the men's wear. I don't know where it is, Bonnie took out the holy book. "I didn't eliminate the memories of the two people last time. It would be a hassle to recognize me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slight prayer, a silver snake The light slammed out from her right hand and slammed along the outer walls and windows of the apartment building. The light came out of the apartment building, sometimes out of the apartment building, and finally stayed in front of a window on the second floor - a magical alarm sounded from the apartment, accompanied by some messy footsteps. After the chaos was almost over, she easily put away the holy book and walked close to the main entrance of the apartment with at least ten pairs of stunned eyes. Of course, there were already alarmed guards waiting there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Troublely tell Mr. Machiavelli, that a friend from the church wants to meet him. I am not malicious." Bonnie lowered her hat and tried to keep her voice down. "I don't want to wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes the less you talk, the more effective it is. The guard apparently had seen her performance before, and quickly ran in to inform - just the form. Bonnie knew that 80% of his masters had already arrived, and they stayed in their place to wait for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I should make an appointment later, instead of using these unconventional means," she thought so in her mind. However, it will wait until her intelligence organization penetrates the world - at the current rate, by 1675 this goal may only be one-tenth. Intelligence organizations have never been established by an order. This line is full of betrayal, competition, cruelty and blood. In this old world with three absolute powers, it seems so difficult to build her ideal country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So I still have to choose one at the end," she whispered a little tiredly, "rather than doing all the dirty work on my own."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time Machiavelli appeared, the male one. The gloomy man wearing a black mage robe on the ship that day was dressed very neatly, and with a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, it looked like an ordinary instrument. Of course, in fact he is not just an ordinary instrument. Seeing the young gentleman with a black top hat in front of him, Machiavelli snorted and looked at the other side and opened his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Behold me rude, you are familiar to me, but I can’t remember where I have seen you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s good, Bonnie whispered in her heart, if it’s a problem for me. She confessed her false background with false: "I am from the church in the southern city. An agent, or a philanthropist - or an investor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Oh." Machiavelli was innocently loyal, just like his usual social interaction, "investors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See In response to this, Bonnie raised her chin a little and put her hand on her lips. She said in a mosquito-like voice: "If you say no to you, can you call out the other half of you? Real Machia... Veri."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sentence, the second secretary of state did not change his face; but Bonnie could see the shock in his eyes. Obviously, he is now recalculating the weight of the "investor" in front of him. The Secretary of State’s secretary was lucky and tried very cautiously: "But Nikola; Machiavelli is a monk. Although I am afraid of assassination, I am not afraid to find a substitute."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I think we should talk to my room." Machiavelli whispered and took her to his room on the second floor. "But she is not in Kengal now."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I see this as a kind of congestion, Mr. Nikola? This is not a good start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that the other party called himself "Nicholas" instead of "Machiavelli", the Secretary of State sighed a sigh: "Believe it or not, she has already gone to the South."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large piece of lead particles crossed the right side of the car, causing a fierce stable. This is the sixth and last. It is a melee that has special effects in melee and is a good weapon for dealing with horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I actually prepared this kind of thing, it seems difficult to be good... Has our purpose been leaked?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green-haired woman thought about it and glanced at the full-fledged ambassador around him - the dude had fainted in the chaos just now. In any case, he will not know her true identity when he wakes up - if he still has a chance to wake up. Losing the horse lost the possibility of mobile protection; now the entire defensive position is full of loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no longer the sound of the opening of large weapons. Through the effect of magic, she barely heard a slight snoring and slamming sound. The other party is preparing for the general attack. According to the establishment of the Free Army, the strength of the other side is about an entire standard class... maybe more, one more, no, two adventurer teams... no, two. Thirteen, nineteen, twenty-four... twenty-four enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Maggie, what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only five guards left in the team. Although the number is in absolute disadvantage, but under the magical effect of the spirit of rejuvenation, no one has retreated. This is her, "Lily; Maggie", all the chips that can be used. Six to twenty-four, only for the mercenary of money, the opponents whose strength is difficult to estimate, are prepared to be completely unprepared... It is difficult to have a worse situation than now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even at the expense of the most secretive identity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lily" I heard a slight footstep swaying between the trees, approaching their carriage. The enemy abandoned the use of firearms and adopted a lightly approaching tactic. Undoubtedly, some people in the Ruhrlock government and the other side confessed to the song; unlike the first two batches of encounters, the target of this group of people is the special envoy. She didn't want to use mental control magic to solve this problem. It is foolish to use magic to control others. It is brilliant to control others with interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to use close combat? It’s hard to say if you win or lose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Girl Take a pair of light green silk gloves from your pocket and put them on your hands. The back of the glove is drawn with mysterious oriental characters and symbols, exuding the scent of cinnamon and full of exoticism. She continued to monitor the opponent's actions: I don't know why, the enemy dispersed, and one pair moved in the direction of the new reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possibility one, they are going to the secret number. Possibility two, the newcomer is the commander, hoping to leave the reserve team. Possibility three... That is not their reinforcements at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the countermeasures are obvious, and it is obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All, ready swords and spears, should you have melee weapons as mercenaries?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards’ swords are hesitant and unrestrained: “But they are much more...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s fine to play a few less.” The long fingers danced quietly under the long sleeves, drawing a magical shackle. “Get up and get ready to meet the first batch!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of spiritual magic, the guards also followed the excitement; just because the environment did not allow them, they did not point the tip of the sword to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this era, except for Maggie, Villi, few people know the decisive role of spiritual control magic in hand-to-hand combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit. What do you want to drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, let me find where the tea is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the request of the guest, Nikola in the suit and shoes climbed into the chair and was busy in the closet Look around, open one small metal box and smell the inside. The box is filled with ambiguous words, some of which are the names of spices such as “**”, “Awei”, “Pepper” and “Pimpinella”, while others are written with a variety of beverage origins. There are a lot of things, but there are very few things in each box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie looked at her master and hurriedly rummaged, suddenly feeling a bit ridiculous. She is now being regarded as the "source of all evils" by Nikolay in the afterlife; in front of Machiavelli, waiting for the other party to entertain her to find tea - all this sounds so illusory, but it is happening. Is there a great man who is well versed in strategy and unethical? Is there such a man who is a good man at home? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Nikola is cooking himself? He has prepared so many spices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, the room is small, the hiring people are too cramped. I am very good at using the citron peppers... ah, there is." Nikolay poured out the darkened dry tea from a small box in the deepest part. It looks like it was soaked in sea water. "Sorry, I haven't bought a new one for a long time. It may not taste too good. Please bear with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang Ni stared at the inferior tea brick, and the corner of her mouth twitched slightly. In this era, tea is imported into the West in the form of tea bricks, but it is really rare to make such a tea brick. Living in such a small apartment, there are no servants with only a few bodyguards, even the tea bricks are the worst. She has not believed that this is a political performance, she would rather believe that this is the nature. Maggie, how did Verry find such a man with no material desire to cover his identity? As a politician, he can be said to be impeccable...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please." I don’t know when Nikola had already brewed tea and pushed it to her. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie picked up the tea without a hint of aroma, pretending to look like tea, slowly said: "We started talking about business. I am going to Kenge this time. Le Lai, on behalf of the Crosso Brothers Bank. Our bank wants to support the crumbling Kegler government."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...so I don't know how How much money can I provide?” The Secretary of State gently shakes the teacup in his hand. “If the loan interest is too high, the parliament will not pass. Even if I am the second secretary responsible for the internal affairs of the Republic, I cannot persuade them to During the period, we borrowed usury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The five-million-dollar gold pound, which is seven thousandths of an annual interest, is all cash. I believe this money is enough to help you get through. The urgent need is equivalent to the sum of the subsidies granted by the other three republics to the northern garrison of Jules. This money has now arrived in Lenny in the form of platinum and gold. I hope that this money can be used to strengthen the defense in the north. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie is not Reported a surprising amount, the money is about three-quarters of all her assets. When I heard this number, even Nikolay took a breath of air. The idea of ​​using this money to supplement the funding gap in the northern defense line is really tempting, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"7 per thousand? As a speculator, this interest is too It’s low. Let’s talk, what else do you want?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Minute wants to get all the government that will be issued in the future under the rule of the Julesian government. The rights to the bond and banknote business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cup in the hands of Nikolay paused and stopped on the table. "At present, our parliament does not have this plan. Do you want to pre-monopolize this right? I am afraid I can't promise you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will soon With this plan, and with your fame, you can definitely fulfill the requirements of the lieutenant. After all, relying on Ruhrock’s own financial resources, it is impossible to support the five free divisions and two national divisions, as well as the huge expenses of the northern defense. And after the outbreak of fighting near Fort Fort, your council will agree.” Bonnie sneered softly. “Your government can't even maintain the usual expenses.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The war will not break out, because the peace envoy has gone to Lenny." Nikolay retorted, "We only need to borrow from local banks, and we can get through the current without issuing public debt." Crisis.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Impossible. When the wheel named Crisis has turned, it has to run over something to stop. You believe in yours. Will the conditions be accepted by the Lenny? They will ask you The conditions that are absolutely unacceptable... For example, the trial of Radz; Govar. After the group of members who have not experienced the war realized the danger, cruelty and expensiveness of the war, there is a possibility of peace talks."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mental control? That thing is not omnipotent. Perhaps another Machiavelli makes you think it is omnipotent, but in fact it has weaknesses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You... even this knows?!” Nikolay stood up in a reflexive manner, stepped back and almost fell over the chair. “Have we ever seen it before? Who are you?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie did not answer this question and chuckled and changed the subject: "Our bank can help you make proposals for bonds and banknotes, we can save this crumbling republic together Anyway, in the end, someone will ask for the issuance of bonds and banknotes, but it is better for us to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the Secretary of State feels himself Like a frog stared by a snake. The wording of this delicate steward seems to be very polite, but the actual meaning inside is tight. Issuing banknotes... is a bold speculator, but he seems to have no choice now. Whether it is public or private. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you give me some time to think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. Wait for you to think clearly In the future, sign this magical contract.” Bonnie dropped a parchment paper with a faint glow and an invitation. “I will go back to prepare for the charity. In the evening, welcome to come and observe, here is the invitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the contract that would be strongly cursed once the breach was breached, the male Nikolay; Machiavelli can only smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The women of this year are all very good. The times have changed... right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long time later, when I recalled my first really sinister battle, Monica was surprised to find that she was not afraid at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because of the strong and trustworthy relationship around them; perhaps because the enemy is not very vicious; perhaps because someone is waiting for them to save; maybe I don't know the danger of the situation... until the end of the battle, she realized the danger of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team blocker who rushed over is definitely not an ordinary soldier or bandit. They are well equipped, each with a length of two muskets and weapons that shine with magical light, and the headed person has a magical full body armor. Not only that, they also have good tactics and strategies, and they have a lot more supporters. In order to deal with the Ninika group, they sent seven people to come. Seven to five, well organized and correct strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They only made a mistake: they should not miscalculate Xiu Lan; Dimartel and Parker; Tap's strength. In order to give priority to the magician, the enemy only sent two people to drag the two men who are not amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is their biggest cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than two minutes, Xiu Lan and Pike broke the skulls of the two men and pierced their hearts. At this time, the enemy's home team has not yet broken through the defense of Reeve and Uncle Jeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mussca’s female pastor is best at “gorgeous battles” – for those who have never seen it, this “gorgeous battle” is really Hard to grasp. The gods of the gods have the dazzling effect and the name of the prestige. The "sacred shield" commonly used by other pastors has become a "glare shield" when it comes to Leifu, and it shines with dazzling light. The colored light balls flying in the air, the glare of the priests, and the mighty wings of the handsome angels summoned the poor mercenaries, madly rushing toward the female priest. Try to remove this biggest danger first. However, they met Uncle Jett who was good at defense. Uncle is not only good at defensive magic, but also good at all kinds of strange fighting techniques. His hands are not so fast, but they always accurately throw the mercenaries out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Raf and Jett attracted the attention of all the enemies, Renee had to hide behind a tree, concentrate on preparing the most ordinary, The flameless arrows of the flowers, one by one attacking the soldiers who were thrown out. In the face of the beauty, sensuality and brilliance of Reeve, she felt like a poor harlequin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, just have a little strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I thought so, Out of a subconscious comparison, she concentrated all her will on the flame arrow in her hand. In the taxonomy of later generations, the sad magic that belongs only to the second paragraph quietly produced subtle changes in her hands. The hot magic arrow gradually turns into a hot spear, not only burning the enemy, but also penetrating the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
