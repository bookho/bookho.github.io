			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the time, it’s already dusk; but the dust is all over the sky, covering all Sunshine. The sandstorm blew wildly, and I don’t know where to start, I don’t know where it will end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge steel track team and camel team, with the ancient trade route slowly moving forward, countless elves ancient place names behind the mark on the travel log . “Lantasville Avenue” means “a beautiful road”. “Siranasti” means “a city that is surrounded by mountains and waters”. “Fmitinia” means “the place where the fog fireworks are produced”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all this is already the dust of history. The cursed yellow sand covers the land of millions of square kilometers east of the edge of the river and west of the mountain range. The glory of the Age of the Elven Empire is no longer seen. Everyone knows that about 1,500 years ago, the governor of the Eastern Province of Elf, before the squadron of the Koman Empire, resolutely turned the entire eastern fertile soil into a legend of the wilderness; and those Warcraft and undead creatures seemed to prove this. a little. Some adventurers rumor that in the center of the Great Wilderness, there is still the capital of an elf empire – or the undead ghost of the elf empire. Today, only the scattered oasis tribes scattered in the wilderness are barely connected to this “crossing road”. Every three caravans starting from Xiping will fall into the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we are different, it will never be destroyed in such a place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The dwarf Tug was thinking about riding on a camel. Even if he has followed Luo Ruide - or Clade; Lopez - for thirteen years, he will still find his elders worthy of admiration from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, this time, the man successfully persuaded one-third of the adult men of the Ain Tucker tribe to join their technology, family and property. A terrible expedition. In order to achieve this goal, he led the tribal warriors to completely eliminate the nearby orcs and goblins, so as to prove that even if they leave, the tribe is safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only been two months since the West Tang’s escorts left the Ain Tucker tribe to organize a huge fleet of westbound trains. The former Western Tang Dynasty discussed the action of the generals and made a strong and powerful to an astonishing degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that. This man is still very determined... all the way to real combat, real. He never let go of any oasis that is smashed by monsters and undead creatures, never. Powerful monsters and undead creatures seem to have become the living targets of his training units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two months of desert travel, Tug was surprised to find that the dwarf friends he was familiar with, except for mechanics, smelting, planting, family and A friend who knows nothing but a vulgar joke has a temperament that is unique to the Western Tang veterans. It is a true veteran temperament, completely different from the pampered banned or peasant soldiers he saw in the Eastern Empire. The Mamluk Cavalry Team is already a true cavalry team - not a singular singer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the closer to the destination, the more serious the situation of undead encroachment on the oasis. In the first month of the journey, they just packed up some robbers; but since entering the second month, one out of every three oasis marked on the map has been uninhabited. This kind of battle has become more and more annoying, and it has led to a considerable degree of reduction in the team - to be honest, 5 percent is already a miracle; but after all, it is also 5 percent, 20 live lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At last I have to camp in the oasis... I hope this oasis has not been encroached by undead creatures..." The dwarf thought uncomfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the scout of the striker came back on a camel and took the smoke. "There is black smoke in the oasis ahead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God..." The dwarf knew it was not good, and hurriedly asked the camel to go where the general was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying sand is not yellow, but black. Black desert, black sand, near the black sky. The sandstorm is very big and it is impossible to get a torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black dust..." Klad; Lopez's brow wrinkled. "Get ready to fight! All unarmed people enter the chariot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times has it been? he does not know. The Great Wilderness is indeed a place where monsters come forth. Every time such a battle can give him "joy", he thought that some monsters have already perished in the long river of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heavy slick gunners are loaded! Light gunners are ready to cover, pistols are concentrated, and they are distributed to the car city personnel to defend themselves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves drive the chariot to The edge of the array was stopped, extinguished, and faced with a black sandstorm. The yellow sandstorm is the wrath of nature, and the black sandstorm is a sign of the evil undead. The black sandstorm, lingering over the oasis in the distance, has not been scattered for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir..." His faithful follower and translator Tug came to his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad; Lopez waved: "You are responsible for arranging defenses and shelling. I am going to scout the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been a commander of the action. Without waiting for the grid to answer, General Lopez’s figure disappeared into the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh yeah." The dwarf had no choice but to prepare for shelling and interception with peace of mind. According to the usual practice, the general will return soon and formulate a tactic of no faults... This cold and meticulous appearance of Klad; General Lopez can always bring strange confidence to the people around him, in the West China, in the Western Tang Dynasty So, in Ain Tucker, this is also true in the Great Wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheikh Oasis, named after being close to Sheikhia, was the capital of the Middle East Road in the Age of Elven Empire. When Clade passed here 15 years ago, it was a very prosperous desert oasis town, relying on agriculture, animal husbandry, commercial transit and antiques for a living. However, fifteen years later, it is already black sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light green invisible threshold appears on the roof of the ruins, and Clade walks quietly out of it, with a spell that has just burned out. Of course, this Taoism is "any door of Cao Cao." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really hope that I can have time to change this Taoism into an arcane..." whispered to himself, General Lopez found a secluded The roof squats and looks at the movement below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is really an undead creature, mainly with zombies that flow out of green rot pus, sometimes with some flaws. To his surprise, the undead creatures here are not as unorganized as the oasis of the past... they seem to be organized and disciplined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If those who have met before are like "sentinel", this encounter is like "castle." Intuition and common sense tell him that there must be high-level, intelligent undead creatures in the vicinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it is undead, there should be leaders and subordinates." He thought with a little malicious thought, referring to the experience he saw in the East. "I don't know if there is an incompetent central command organization and awkward local bureaucracy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad; Lopez took a few more characters from his arms. Considering it over and over again, take out a bird form of burning. An inconspicuous black bird then crossed the sky - this thing is not hidden by the invisible eye magic used to detect in the arcane, but the speed is fast; this kind of thing is called the god by the Orientals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Lopez focused his eyes on the blackbird and carefully observed the deployment of enemies in the ruins. The town seems to have been burned for a little while, and it should be the remains of the undead attack. The undead creatures did not bother to rebuild these buildings, but in the rest of the building they picked up some of the houses that were fairly intact as their own units. Several whole rows of houses were chosen as blacksmiths, and there was a bang in it. In the other direction of the town, the scorpions and zombies built a blast furnace, which seemed to be iron making. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ironmaking...? They won't make gunpowder?" Lopez was surprised and ordered to fly in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another street, he not only discovered the anticipation of the gunpowder factory, but also found a barracks in surprise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a grave of ordinary undead, but a real barracks. A large group of undead creatures are listed on the “playground” as a neat array. - As a mage, Klad is fully aware of the difficulty of making undead creatures without intelligence into a square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods carefully looked at the battle of the undead. Each squad has a ghoul whose appearance looks like a normal life, with no derogation and flexible action; Clade knows that this intellectual undead is in very harsh manufacturing conditions, must be dead and retained. Wisdom creatures with the resurrection will be made. As for the "person" who has been standing in the center of the field and admiring all the zombies and jealousy, the general is not sure what it is: it looks like red blood, dark brown carrion and white bones mixed together. , a form of human form that barely made up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Lopez was shocked and hurriedly liberated the soul. At the same moment he was liberated, he felt a slight pain in his chest, and it seemed that fatigue had raided him. He knows that his god has vanished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible... Does it have dark vision or super-perception?" The man who mastered the Eastern method muttered to himself and began to consider whether to change the tactics. Speaking of super-perception, he suddenly remembered a legendary undead. "It won't be a war corpse? Killing monsters made with the flesh and soul of the death warrior, and this 'mixture' is a bit like..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The situation is a bit strange! It seems that someone is scouting us! The whole begins to search!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some hoarse screams, the following people - no, the following undead creatures Start stupid. The mixture is obviously the leader, and the command is sent from his mouth, passed to the ghoul, and then passed to the zombies and us. Lopez, who is proficient in various languages, hears that the command seems to be an ancient Elvish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This seems a bit dangerous..." He felt a bit of pain in his stomach, which was a sequela of fifteen years of travel in a foreign country. After biting his teeth, the general pulled out a light blue sword and caught it in his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flying Sword" is regarded as the highest state of Taoism in the Eastern Empire. Today, the empire of the Flying Sword can be practiced in the Eastern Empire. Two or three. The phrase "Yu Fei Jian" is used to refer to the person who has already been in the Taoist practice. To do this step, it usually takes more than ten years of hard work; to control the flying sword freely, often It takes decades of hard work. Luo Ruide has been able to control Feijian in six years, which is the second fastest record in his master's history. The fastest record in the history of the true repairing school is Feijian, which is five years. The genius is him. Master. After the cultivation of Feijian, Luo Ruide chose to return to the west, and his master chose to go to the East China Sea province.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the theory of magic The magical items of "soul connection" are quite dangerous, and may cause confusion or even death. They are often classified as "cursors" in the West. When traveling in the East, Clade often hears "swords in people." In the sentence, the death of the sword is dead. He knows that this sentence does not only represent a determination. If the use of flying swords is excessive, it will not only be excessive fatigue. It is not a last resort, Clade; Lopez never wants to use Come out with this secret weapon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how long it can be used today? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead creatures all mobilized, and those who are supposed to rest in peace are vigilantly searching for the caster.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This description may be somewhat inappropriate. To be precise, there are only about twenty intelligent undead creatures searching, and the rest will only look at the target and stare at it. The ghoul and the war corpse are separated. All the crickets and zombies of their hands were sent out, and they themselves looked for the place where the zombies were piled up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they soon No need to search anymore.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Because their search targets have taken the initiative.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dream! "Crad whispered the name of his flying sword.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch of light blue crossed the sky above the ruins of Sheikhia. All the zombies Slowly raised his head and stared at the sky "wrongly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krad; Lopez attached all his spirit to the flying sword, The power of "Broken Dream" flies in the air. He trembles in the cloak and takes a revolver from the left side of the belt on the waist. It is a black handle with a silver-white body and a forged metal. The pistol.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰!砰!砰!砰!砰!砰!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long been optimistic The location of all the ghouls, the silver devil bullets raided from the air to these intellectual leaders; four of them immediately turned into dust, two barely escaped, but lost balance, followed by the light blue Jianguang has two and a half! After this round of raids, one-third of the zombies lost their direct leadership and began to walk in a stagnant position.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; After the first round of raids, General Lopez stopped the flying sword and stayed on the roof of the Orthodox Church in the center of the town. He saw the monster below has begun to riot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"唿..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good dirty attack... is the god of the gods destroyed by this thing?" The light blue light shone, and the intestines hit the twelve-pointed star sign of the Orthodox Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh...you are blaming the sacred covenant." After that, the Protestant Clade pulled another revolver from the right belt. This time, this is a black handle with a black body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dust to dust, earth to earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six broken magic bullets The rancid air flies in a straight line to the war soul! The "left hand", "right hand", and "left leg" all wore big holes in an instant, but the monster still barely stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唿...!" The soul of the war corpse sends a squeak of pain and anger, and throws his arms at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break the dream!" Seeing each other wants jade and burn, Clade; Lopez also called out his flying sword. The light blue ray is brightened and turned into countless little swords, woven into a blue escort ring next to Clade! When the two "flying arms" touched this light net, they were instantly smashed into pieces, and no piece of debris could get into Clade's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, it’s dying." Blu-ray turned into a ray, and all the little swords flew toward the corpse of the war, thoroughly penetrating it; this The "mixture" finally turned into blood and flesh on the ground. After confirming that the enemy leader was disposed of, Clade took out a long-awaited "controlling corpse" from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The East does not jeopardize the Necromancer. In this respect, they seem to be much more advanced than us. Until now, the undead is still being smashed. The sects retreat to heresy. In the East, this technique can be done freely in the form of a scroll... Is it to say that we are rigid, or that they have no moral beliefs?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought this way, General Lopez burned the corpse in his hand to the ashes; the undead creatures below were quickly under his control and began to guilty. Seeing that there are still a few remaining ghouls who want to clean up the mess, Clade has thrown two fireballs in the direction of the powder magazine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge explosion immediately rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unsurprisingly, undead creatures really won't add fire enchantment. But why don't even the dead creatures start iron making and gunpowder..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With unanswered doubts, Clade flew back to the team. As soon as he gathered the sword, he felt very hard and took his chest and rested on the "Cradd gun car". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir? You look a little tired." Tug saw him back and hurried forward to care. "Oh... what taste... so strange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, just fighting is a bit hard." The middle-aged man gave him a look and wiped his head. The sweat, ignoring his last problem. "Now I am urging the whole army to advance! Use the incendiary bombs to burn the town... No, the ruins are completely burned! Let's go now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf squats and hurries to turn around set off. After taking over the subordinates, the generals had some helplessness to pull out their flying sword "broken dreams." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue blade exudes an unbearable stench. If you slash the undead creature for a long time, it will indeed smell bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the team set off from the ruins that had been burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing happened in the later journey; it seems that the terrible undead is just a phantom in some areas. After walking for another twenty days along the traverse road, they finally saw the edge river. To the west of the edge of the river is a region of human civilization with fertile water and fertile land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Lopez jumped off the camel and came to the river to pick up a long-lost river and send it to his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The motherland... I am back." He looked at the wide river and muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team turned to the south, and after about two hours, they saw the place to cross the river. It is a small town called gatebridge. Through the power of those steel steam vehicles, Lopez quickly "convinced" the town's guards. The homing pigeon then took off and flew to the fourth cavalry division "Glory" at the station in Bairley, and then transferred the message to the center through the senior master there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebellious general of the former Western Tang Dynasty became an officer directly at the headquarters of the Freedom Army, commanding the Third Independent Artillery Corps (also known as the First Clade Artillery Corps). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, what is the identity? Travel coach? Master Shuai? Jun Shuai? Defend the general? Zhu Guoda General?" Departed from Lenny On the way, Tug asked inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Klad; Brigadier General Lopez smiled a little. "We don't need this rank here."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three weeks later, in the late autumn of 1664, the glorious capital of the Republic of the Union, the symbol of freedom, democracy, equality, and fraternity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Free State United Defense Supreme Command" is a three-story ring building located in the North 2nd district of Lenni, the capital of the Federal Republic of The most striking building in the area. People in the military world generally call this "ring", which corresponds to the "Northern Empire", the highest command of the Northern Empire - just as people often use "Deland" instead of the central government of the North, and "Lenny" "Replace the central government of the South." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please inform, the new head of the third independent artillery, Klad; Lopez, to meet with the Chairman of the Freedom Army Staff Conference, Conti; Fox y forx) Marshal "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, the Marshal is about to hand over the power, there are orders to see the visitors..." He saw no shoulders on his shoulders and neckline, the reception Miss secretary is hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please tell him that it is Clade; Lopez is visiting." The middle-aged man has been replaced with the blue uniform of the Free Army, which looks extraordinarily heroic. "You can check the memo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His deep and cold tone and vicissitudes of expression made Miss Secretary dare not refuse, and soon notified the nearby non-commissioned officers. . The sergeant heard the name and thought about it. He turned over the memo and was surprised to find that the man’s name was in a very high position; he hurried away and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For fifteen years, there has been no change in the Fortress...and even bureaucracy." Lopez took out his pocket watch, "From here to the top floor." In the chairman's office, it should be eight minutes to go back and forth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eight minutes and thirty seconds, the sergeant returned on time: "Marshal Fox asks you to go immediately. I am here to lead the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kradben wanted to say "no need", his lips moved twice, and after all, there was no opening. Five minutes later, the serge led him to the chairman's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, Klad; Lopez..." The sergeant glanced at the shoulders of the middle-aged man, "...to."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you retire." A seemingly kind white-haired old man sits on the swivel chair that symbolizes the highest position, facing away from the visitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the sergeant left, Lopez spoke up: "Teacher, you look no different from fifteen years ago."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" The old man turned his seat and faced him. The marshal star on the shoulder of the old man is shining. "Your change is great, Clade; Lopez."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am too self-willed, I have not been able to go to the military information you have arranged." The bureau is still fifteen years old..." Klad said, "I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, you don't have to feel guilty." The old Marshal waved his hand. "I think that in the past fifteen years, what you have got should be more than a military intelligence bureau. I read your report, it is really valuable, maybe we should strengthen it. Communication with distant countries. The 'Craded Gun' is also very valuable, that is why I intend to reuse you... Unfortunately, you come back a bit late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"A bit late?" Clade eyebrows pick one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am planning to retire next month." Conti; Fox said, "I am afraid I will never have the opportunity to bring you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it to? Ladz; Govar, or Wiener; Bezi,?" asked Clade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gowar, he is more energetic. Betsy is too conservative, I am worried that he can't cope with Gustav; I am now letting him guard the Northeast Military Region. By the way In one sentence, Govar is scheduled to rise to Marshal at the end of this month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
