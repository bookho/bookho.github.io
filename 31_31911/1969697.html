Soledon raised his horse speed to an unprecedented level and headed straight to the welfare home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen couldn’t tell why he felt a little uneasy, but there was a feeling that he felt he had to abandon all the distractions. It seems to be an intuition made up of ambition and uneasiness. He always vaguely feels that something is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the intuition on the battlefield, sometimes you just know that you want to catch the reserve team. Sometimes you know that you want to counter-impact. Sometimes you know that you want to pull The speed of the escape from the other side will kill a magic. Without this intuition, a strong magician would die from a small stray bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think carefully, Nanaemon feels that he should be able to sort out the context. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the source of this emotion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting clue should be Fox Marshal's speech at the Joint Council. It was indeed a very moving and passionate speech. If Nami was not in the staff for a few months, he would not be able to calm down and think about the true intention behind the speech, but instead cast his vote directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That said, I don't seem to have citizenship yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is self-deprecating In a sentence, a junior officer without citizenship is undoubtedly the first case in the history of the Free Army. When an average person is promoted to a major, he must be over 30 years old, and the military in the first half of this position can donate a citizenship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before becoming a citizen, he became a combat staff first, which allowed him to learn a different perspective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the freedom of songs and the vision of the future, the marshal actually achieved only one operational goal. That is obviously obvious." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is flying by the free army soldiers from the team after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Fox gave a speech, the old Marshal had crossed the parliament to release all the orders that made up the New Rennie Army. Those teams whose history is less than one morning are searching for civilians, escorting the squadrons and captives, and cleaning up the remaining ruling parties... Yes, this is the purpose of Fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants to keep the Free Army. He disbanded the parliament and established the military government. As long as he can keep the last seed of the Free Army, he can do anything. If democracy becomes a stumbling block, he doesn't care about throwing it away. After all, isn't an army democratic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hundreds of imperial captives whizzed through the numbness of these people. For the soldiers at the bottom, whether it is the Free Army, the Emperor or the public, it is just a symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I think what Marshal Fox wants to tell me is not 'contradictions'. All the politics are contradictory and filthy. This should not be me. Feelings of emotion. So, is the problem on the 'combat goal'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be some key points. Looking at the door and looking at the three pillars of smoke not far from the front, listening to the sound of the gunshots from time to time, decided to take the risk of copying a shortcut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you just want to reorganize the Lenny Army and 'stop the production of the government,' you don't have to take the position of the dictator. Obviously it is a proposal that cannot be passed by normal methods. Our strategy is not bad. If our army is strong, what is the enemy? Why did he choose this goal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just thinking of it, the back of the corner of the door to the corner of a burned material warehouse. He secretly concealed his "stupid talent", which is really a mistake that should not be made for a staff member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naimen remembered the old Marshal, no, the dictator said, "The chain of the old Republic was broken." That is true: to rebuild a free army is the greatest opportunity for a young officer like him. Just like if there was no previous civil war, he would not be a major officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this can only explain half of the intuition ambition, can't solve the source of uneasiness... So what makes me uneasy is the 'means'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen jumped out of Malay in front of the broken gate of the Welfare Institute and stepped over the ruins in three steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the naked eye, you can't see the light blue magic line of the magic net, but as long as you use the eye of reading magic, you can see that it has been covered. The effect line that is being connected in the day. After the Magic Net officially launches, they will disappear visually, but will bring new rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The proposal for the chapter on excellence is actually just a duke. At the end of the day, what Fox has done is to use it to build it... what to say, 'inertia' In this way, he will allow parliamentarians to accept public voting that would not have been accepted, and also use the outside army to put pressure on them. He also used the ruling party's habit of pursuing pragmatism and opposition parties to pursue the momentum."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is constantly thinking about everything in the heart, opening the door to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the entrance to the secret base had been automatically closed, and since he left the transfer array last time, he did not know how to open from this side. He slammed his feet on the floor and could hear the empty echo from below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even the best politician, it is difficult to resist the power of inertia. Whether it is a former general or a professional politician of the tyrannical tycoon, can not put forward himself in the face of the practice Opposition. So, the secret entrance switch here is probably also..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is frowning and starts looking for hidden hidden magic arrays in his room. . It is not difficult to find, in fact it is inadvertently engraved under his bed, just like all lazy wizards will choose. He reached out and output magic to start the magic array, and the inscription above began to shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the secret entry is not open. The door was frowned and identified the magical array that used some unknown technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relative coordinate confirmation, use identity confirmation, special order rejection...Is the input time after I left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; His gaze gaze at the magical array, and the uneasiness in his heart is getting stronger. Why does Anne want to enter a special order to prohibit him from opening the entrance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you feel so upset when you see these magical arrays? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contradictions. Benefits. Inertia. Contradictions. Benefits. Inertia..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three The words are connected together, and the door is suddenly shaken. He finally understood the cause of his intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... is this the case?! She never said...Yes, she never said it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned sharply and slammed on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"earthspike!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slate entrance of the secret passage is one Rows of pointed spikes, pointing to the roof - no, even piercing the roof! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm stupid! It's stupid! How could I not find it! That inference is simply unreasonable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is not surprised by the unexpected effect of this magic, cursing his own dullness, kicking the spike and kicking it out of the resulting hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, we have our own positioning points in Interry and the New World", "There will be new cities in the next two hundred years", "Because I The spare body must be replaced in Interrail, and of course my spare body cannot be so close to the battlefield." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contradictions, interests, practices. The technique used by the Fox dictator is exactly the same, exactly the same. Even the "reasonable decision-making motivation produces uncomfortable results" is exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the door to concentrate all spirits, prepare to cope with possible traps, and shout the name of the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie! It's me, I'm back, don't start the trap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have a lifetime They didn't scream with such a loud voice, and he never knew that his voice could be so hoarse. His throat was almost torn, and the treble was pulled out with the utmost strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This voice...resistant door? Why? Don't, don't come in! The magic net is about to start, it's dangerous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slight weakness in the voice coming from the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not stop at all, but ran faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His military boots kicked on the ground, inspiring dense echoes in the tunnel, just like a thousand horses rushing past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't, don't run! Magic net...Hey! Hey! Have you heard it?! I will put down the fire door, but don't say I didn't Say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the door near the end of the passage, I saw that the fire door cast with fine gold is slowly falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swayed his right hand and the magic was thrown on the ground in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grease!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he slipped and leaned over yet Close the gap under the door seam and drill it. There was no hesitation in the whole movement. The fire door fell behind him, hitting the ground and making a heavy impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door stood up and wiped the oil on his body. He smiled bitterly: "Fortunately, there is no official uniform."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, are you crazy?" Anne's voice lost her previous calm, her hand was stopping at the control magic table. "Do you know that the door can die?" You!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I am crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is from greasy Stepping away, crossing the magic circle to Anne who is operating the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne reluctantly lifted her body and lifted her hand from the table, suspending the operation of the magic array. Her magical left arm was full of magic lines, and her right hand stopped knitting. Even at this distance, Nanimen could see the panic and shake in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you suddenly coming back, is there any urgent matter? Is the emperor coming back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I would rather be crazy." Resist the door and repeat it, walked through the hall. "Why not. My damn bastard bastard has discovered the truth. It is enough, OK, Anne. Don't continue Going on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny puts on her smiling expression and spits out her tongue - but this is the hardest time I have ever seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and said: "What's wrong? It's like you found something that is incredible..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This base is not an independent transfer point. You never said it, you have never admitted it, right? Anne? You are using the Lenny Center transfer point positioning."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two steps of the doorstep, put his school official five-star on the table, staring at Anne’s eyes, just like to put her every beautiful The same in my own mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about, Soledon... Major?" Anne stepped back and smiled stiffly. "Promoted, sir." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s enough, Annie. Don’t go on!” Nana’s heart is getting colder and colder. “My problem is only one – 'You really can Use this transmission array to reach Intre and replace the spare body in time??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s hand shook a bit, but did not touch his shoulder . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not the time to do this kind of game... sir, the magic net is about to start, I am really."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said it was enough, Annie. Don't force yourself." Resistance looked up. "The coordinates of your line and the coordinates of the parliament building are almost the same. There will be a new city in the future, but the world's second largest city, Lenny. The position of the point is definitely not going to change, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie took another step back and hit the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your bronze medal is relative to "Lennie Central Transfer Point", right! This transfer point will continue to be used, no one will To change this coordinate point! How can you use an anchor point that has been destroyed to reach Intre?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is grabbing his school star, rushing She grabbed her shoulders hard and stared at her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls are not struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me, holding a polygraph star telling me, 'You can', Annie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The door is almost in vain. He grabbed Annie's right hand and put his school lie star ring on her finger. He has been looking at her with all his hopes, his eyes can't be removed, his fingers are shaking, and he hasn't been able to fit in twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Sefer has removed his gaze, extended his right hand ring finger and put on a ring. Her fingers are still shaking, without the stability and accuracy that any senior mage should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered the sight she had seen when she returned to Lenny last night. She remembered the despair and panic that she felt at the time, and remembered the scene when she went to the parliament building without aim, and remembered the unmistakable death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard. Why come back. Asshole. So I am not like a fool funny character."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also remembered the embarrassment and uneasiness of her own deception of Soledon, remembered the statements that were false when they were true, and thought of designs that all point to misunderstandings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, she did unconsciously leave clues that would allow him to see the double trap...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie still smiles, but there is a vibrato in her voice: "Why. This is the first time I have done a double trap. I thought I was doing very well."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks like she will cry at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen knows that his reasoning is correct this time, but he also wants to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I heard that. I heard your inner voice. I know that you left so many clues to let me discover. Sorry, I found it too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to say this, but he can’t say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never hated the modern transfer magic system as he does now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sub-transfer points do not know the absolute position of the Lenny transfer point. Because the Lenny transmission point has been destroyed, all relative protocol transmission points based on this point can not be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie told him that the final insurance had long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can’t go to Intre and can’t get her backup body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she already knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did you know it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lenny's transfer location has all been destroyed, you know it? You started when you returned to Lenny... Did you know? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Annie lowered her head and adjusted her emotions. "I have been there since I came back."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, there are still up to four hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Annie looked up again, her crying expression disappeared, only the corners of her eyes were still Some are moist. She broke her right wrist out of the palm of her hand and put it back to her waist. She touched the crystal-like structure covered in the wound and said: "After all, it is just a magical tool for lifesaving. After the delay, it can't maintain more than two. Fourteen hours. Of course, it certainly can't support the rebuilding of the Magic Net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door immediately understood this sentence. But he still hopes to ask: "Can you change a new set of substitute organs when the magic net is established?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne shook his head and answered Road: "No need. This body can not support such a large amount of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one question left to ask... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a problem that is particularly obvious, but it is extremely difficult to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She designed this double deception on the premise of knowing the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She broke the main army of the Empire on the premise of knowing the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows all this and her own destiny, doing so much, so many, so many things, and still laughing, not just laughing It also reversed the laughter of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Sefer is returning to Lenny and investing in her fight knowing the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She always knew that she had only the last twenty-four hours left. The fly is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, a girl, fights the fate of the entire world. Because she wants to change her destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been smiling, not only smiling, but also trying to make everyone smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the appearance of a natural, cute, smiling girl, is the tough mind of a true top mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not even a strong smile; she really believes that she should live like this, bringing joy, laughter and hope to the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door can't imagine what it would be if you were mortal. He certainly can't cover the fact... No, it's impossible to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I do this with strong beliefs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... she is not for them. She is for me, only to stay in Lenny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in this case, she even deliberately conceived two deceptions, trying to prevent him from knowing the truth. If you don't notice the bronze medal, until the end, he won't know the fact, he will only think she went to Interre! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why didn’t she let him know... This is obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew from the outset why the Lenny transfer point was destroyed and who destroyed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she doesn’t want him to blame himself. Nana can even guess, she will encounter an "accident" in the process of establishing the magic net, "this accident" will lead her to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without his responsibilities, there is nothing at all, and Anne will not leave any clues this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is holding the last hope and asks: "We should also find a priest who can be treated..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's impossible now." Annie shook her head. "Lenny didn't have such a high-level priest. I checked it when I built the magic net. Jena, Blenheim and Imeia. There is, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words are not finished. Now that the Lennie positioning point has broken, it is impossible to arrive at the normal speed in any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie, is there a way? Will it be... die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt a little hot in the corner of his eyes, and some water ran down his cheeks. It’s probably raining in the house, or some magic has lost control, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie stretched out her right hand and wiped his eyes for him. "Don't cry. No need. I won't die, but I lost a body... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a typical high-level wizard-style statement. Nanimen really wants to believe this sentence, but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabs Anne’s right wrist again: “It’s enough, Anne. Look at the lie star, It is bright."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride was struggling twice because she suddenly grabbed her wrist, but the door will never let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne had to sigh and explained: "This thing is sometimes too...sensitive. In theory, I do die. This body becomes cold." If the soul goes away from the body, it will happen. This is the definition of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes turned, obviously on her own fingers. Lie Detector. But since the ring is not bright, the door does not want to be revealed, continue to listen to Anne's explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I also have a backup body in Interlake. It will instantly store my super, uniqueness, recognition and representation, or soul. Depending on what you believe in the theory of mental structure. The only thing that needs to be transferred in person is just memory. And I have a super treasure that can hold memories... If you don't want to let go, take out the necklace from my chest. You should I have seen it many times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was subconscious and let go of the hand, looking into the deep ditch between Anne’s proud double peaks, swallowed The swallowing water said: "Where, I have never seen it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have used it before." Annie said, reaching out from the cleavage Pulling out the necklace, the huge sapphire pendant looks extraordinarily familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When, of course, never used!" Nana said that he suddenly felt wrong. "Oh, no, you are talking about necklaces."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny shakes her right hand and wraps the necklace around her wrist, and laughs out with a sigh: "The yellow joke is pretty good, and the door is sir. In short, wait for me to end. Magic, you send the necklace to Interry and re-integrate the memory into my other body. The problem is solved. It is just a technical death. It is not even a soul stone."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the problem is solved, you don't have to stare at me." The door pointed straight into this point. "What about the body after you die?" Wake up from sleep? What happens when she has no memory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body is now petrified and preserved in the crystal... Of course, after receiving the soul This body will wake up as I am. You can think so, I just closed my eyes here and fell asleep, and in another A place wakes up and loses all previous memories. In theory, it is just amnesia, and that is all. Then you bring my memory to me, the memory is restored, the problem is solved, and I am grateful... cough."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s because it’s too quick, Anne coughed a few times, and from her mouth a stream of red blood and a mixture of blue fluorescence Into the liquid. She hurriedly wiped the blood from her hand, but everything fell into the eyes of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time is really not much. I have been postponed for five minutes and can't wait any longer. The magic net has been built to this extent, I have to finish my work. Can you let it go, endure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie's tone cannot be rejected. Naimen knew that what she said was true, and he silently opened his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl showed her habitual smile and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although my misinformation has not been successful, I don't want you to feel sad...but anyway..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly picked up her toes and kissed him gently on his lips, saying in the smallest voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I still thank you Come back, endure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The once stagnation of the magic net, running again. There is no roaring loud noise, only the calm flashes shine from time to time. Those silk threads use the simplest rules to create the greatest achievement in the history of magical science. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door saw the magic line coming out of the gap between Anne’s left arm and kept entering the huge magic net. He couldn't count how many thread lines extended from here to the sky - perhaps the entire civilized world had been connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the legend, the world's best magician is nearing the end, there is a chance to leave a curse that is enough to change the world. This is true. There are still a lot of these curses running, such as the biggest curse on the Great Wilderness of the East, and what I want to leave is not a curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne Sefer calms down, her broken body no longer trembles. The legs made entirely of magic are deeply tied to the ground, and the lines are not moving, slender and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to leave hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, the most powerful magician of the world, Anne Seifer, will build the magic net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s right hand is lifted from the table and pointed to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the door felt a wind blowing from her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because this magic has never been used, it has no spells. So, every word I will follow will follow my will. My beliefs and my logic have become part of this great magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie no longer coughs, no longer bleeds, the whole time seems to be Quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This world is not fair, some people have power, some people do not. But the world is fair, because beliefs and knowledge determine all the power of people. There are many people who have contributed to the world, but they have not received the rewards they deserve. Therefore, they hide the secrets of knowledge from each other, so that these secrets can only be used by themselves. The great men separate the achievements of magic technology. To meet their own wishes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sorrow in the door. The strongest magician must have the strongest belief, although she may not always hang it on her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will leave my hopes to ordinary people like Nana who have no blood, background, humble, but never give up hope. I will Leaving the opportunity to make people a great opportunity. This is the desire of the world's strongest magician, Anne Sefer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She always deliberately Avoid the words "end of death" and "death." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standard calendar 1834, the first artificial magic network connection experiment was completed in DeLand. In 1874, a three-way handshake agreement was proposed in the New World far from the war, and The experiment was successful. In 1882, the first wireless magic network connection magic was completed, and became the first panoramic magic used after the war. In 1890, the international magic network agreement was signed. In 1894, all experimental magic nets merged into the international magic network. In 1896, the magic net crossed the endless ocean. In my time, as long as there is the same civilization, the same magic, the same rules in all areas except the Great Wall, this is the sum of all the knowledge for thousands of years. The belief that breaking all the barriers is there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Naimen can still hear every word she said - no, those spells are specially read to him. of. Each mage has its own system of mantras, some of which are more general and some of which are more casual. The magic used by Annie is obviously only her master, she is willing to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic net only achieves the same function: connect all magical things on a voluntary basis. It will integrate all the magic in the world. From now on, the magic will cover the earth like the ocean, and knowledge will spread like an island. Anyone who discovers new science, knowledge and technology will expand this magic net and bring power to the magic net. They will be rewarded. From the beginning, the magic net is not used to support magic; it is used to support fairness, justice and freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She The sapphire necklace in the hand lit up. Annie placed it in the center of the table and gently stroked its surface with her fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light is getting brighter and brighter, through her military uniform, shining through the room. Looking through the blue light, under the thin military uniform, the substitute organ made of crystal is completely transparent, and the door can see the light source of blue light through her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I firmly believe that everyone's right to learn and use them is inviolable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She stated her wishes and the purpose of establishing the magic net. All of Anne Sefir’s doubts have disappeared, and she is convinced of her own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I firmly believe that this right is the basic guarantee for their survival, freedom and the pursuit of happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the era she wants, and the past she wants; and she creates the hope she wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are no more destitute scholars, no more hidden curses, no more proof of theorem of loss, courage and intuition will outweigh experience and Sleek. This is my wish, a future of thinkers and scientists. A future with justice and justice. I don't know what the future will be, but I believe it will be a future with boundless hope."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s eyes swept through the room. The blue lines in this room have all been connected and bundled into bundles. If you ask the door to ask, Anne will tell him that the shape of the magic thread is a "cluster rocket." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Analysis of static reality - the sum of all objective cognitions. Composes dynamic reality - the sum of all subjective perceptions. Then, if our ideals do not match reality, Just change the reality. The gods create everything; and we create the future. The future created by human reason transcends the future above destiny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the blue light reached its maximum, Anne slowly covered her right hand on the sapphire pendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Soul of the Soul - as the first source node - start shaking hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic The establishment of the net is like a plague. Its algorithm passes from one soul to the next, from one object to the next. Whether it is arcaneism or magic, whether it is Taoism or yin and yang, whether it is geology or feng shui, whether it is spiritual power or shaman, all magic sources and all theories will be woven into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First handshake. Request from subjective beliefs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't do it right or The wrong judgment is to accept all knowledge; when beliefs conflict with each other, it will patiently wait for different beliefs to produce harmony. It contains everything that everyone can know. No matter who owns the knowledge, or who owns the belief, it will be compiled into this giant network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second handshake. Represents a response to static reality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blu-rays are airborne The "magic line cluster bomb", and then divided into two: one continues to move forward, the other turns into red light, the original return, the card of the soul in the hands of Anne - now the first node. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third handshake. The sharing of knowledge and the transmission of power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Light and The blue light glows and turns into a purple light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look closely, you can see that this purple color is actually spirally intertwined by the red magic line and the blue magic line. The blue light in Anne's hand is extinguished, and it shoots at the node that was previously contacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s index finger and thumb are in the shape of a pistol, and she poses a gesture of illusion in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the magic net, the sum of all knowledge and beliefs, the gathering of all magic. Just three times of shaking hands, we can build over the gods "Weiye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she said,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the intricately huge magic coil was ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the blue light becomes two beams, the two beams become four beams, the four beams become eight beams, and the eight beams become sixteen beams...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then, the door I can't see the dazzling fireworks that dazzled him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only saw one after another of the blue light coming out, and countless red light responded to them, mixed into purple light, and then made more More blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blu-ray hits the wall of the hall, hits the ceiling, penetrates the upper floor, and spurs along the rock. Some blue light hits the place where there is no magic group, there is no red light reflection, just disappearing quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More blue light emerges from the vent hole along the magical blast of the explosion. They explode in the air twice, three times or more, and will shake hands infinitely. Pass it down until the end of the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar scene he once saw - it was during the Jena battle, he saw Metty Crosso made with the organ A similar scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the nature of the two is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metti's organ music magic is the pinnacle of human programming magic. The best geniuses and the best magical devices are combined to create a complex and beautiful storm of encounter with the most audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic net made by Anne is exactly the opposite. It follows a very simple principle, just "send a magical group that can expand the handshake to a responding handshake." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is a very simple principle. After ingeniously inspiring the design, it has created a beautiful and grand effect than the masterpiece of Metty's painstaking play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the moment when magic has entered modern times from modern times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the birth of the modern magic net, the magicians were trapped in the question of "how to get knowledge." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From then on, the magicians will be trapped in a new problem of "how to use knowledge." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning magic no longer depends mainly on your luck, your talent and your origin, but mainly on your understanding, your determination and your willingness Give your heart and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a whole world waiting for a new generation of magic users to build. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few blue lights shot at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door saw two great chapters on his body shot back to the red light, his gun shot back to the red light, even his military uniform and military uniform A few potions in the pocket also reflected red light. Their magic is not as amazing as Anne's sapphire necklace, but it is enough to shine with the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he suddenly felt very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, maybe it shouldn’t be said that the body is heavy, but the weight that disappeared because of the acceleration of the magic is back again. It feels no stranger - when Anne built the temporary magic net last night, he experienced it once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical group of the entire hall has exploded, all the blue lines, red lines and purple lines have disappeared from his vision, and the surrounding magic light sources are all extinguished. Only a few oil lamps that can be illuminated without magic are still burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence. Just like every time you build a magic net, after changing the rules, all magic will be silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the moment when the laws of magic change, all magic effects will disappear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Endurance suddenly realized what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed in the direction of Annie, just in time for all the magical effects of her disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fell into his arms, almost no weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s legs and left arm with magical power disappeared, and the crystal substitute organs made of magic also lost their luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My work is done. I can't be a magic net center like the temporary magic net. The magic net covering the whole world needs to have its own agreement. I know that some people are more familiar with similar work with God signing a deal or a covenant. ..." said the girl who lost all magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding lights are dim and dark, and the door can't see her expression, but he knows she is still laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was carefully holding her body, her hands trembled, and she squeezed a few words from her teeth: "Annie, don't talk, we can Find a cure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to worry. Even if the magic net protocol has not yet taken effect, now the magic of my life is still valid, just the operation process. It’s a bit more complicated and it’s a bit more expensive. It should take a few more minutes.” Annie grabbed the sapphire that had dimmed from the table and held it in her hand, opening the subject. “Although short, it’s a wonderful time. Ah. We have joined hands to change the fate, you, and me, two people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice has become hoarse. However, her strong mental strength makes these sentences still sound complete. The time she used to train the spell's pronunciation must be several times or even dozens of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why why, Anne? Is this worth it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, I don't "Know," said the girl. "So I want to know. I want to know if there is a different path leading to a world where people with reason and knowledge can live freely. People like you. I want to give you strength... No, it is an opportunity for you to gain strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie has lost the ability to control her own narrative, and those words have begun to lose logic, she is just busy Tell the words you want to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic net is a tool that transcends the times. Advanced technology tools can change the contrast of power itself, it will give strength to those who have no power. Change power It will change the distribution of power, change society, and change the lives of all people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the loss of all magic now, her eyes are no longer as shiny as before But still as firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no power, the power and the rich are not even willing to take out even one point. There are many people who are afraid of magic and are afraid. Science. They are afraid of the unknown, they are afraid of the future. They are afraid of this, they are afraid of it. It may be a blood-stained future - only under the tree of power that is watered with blood, we can move forward. Let them always Fear and trembling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Anne stopped and looked into the ceiling vents, seemingly waiting for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no opening for the door. He was afraid that he would cry when he opened his mouth. He now understands what the price of victory is... what a high price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She hasn't finished yet." Annie shook her head and continued. "In fact, even I don't know if I am correct. But I know." The free country of this era is not enough. I have said before that the bureaucratic system will inevitably collapse, and there are many things about the democratic system that can tell you in advance... but there is no time. If we are confessing to each other, there are still a few How good it is, even a few weeks. I always can't help but say, will it seem a bit annoying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie can feel her own Thinking slowly slowed down. She has too many words to say, but she doesn't know how much time she has. She doesn't even know if this body can survive to the Magic Net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can tell you the conclusion. The history I know proves that you, the sacred Coman Empire established by Nerman? Hugh Coleman is this The greatest polity of the era. If in case... I mean, in case, the chance is very low, after all, this possibility cannot be ruled out, I have not been able to resurrect... you go to the empire. There are more opportunities there. Some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Resist the door and nod. His eyes were filled with tears and he couldn’t stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie stretched out her only right hand and gently touched his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't cry, my hero. I still need you. Although you are not him, not that person...but..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love you too. Really. I love you in the future, I also love you now. It’s really troublesome. This is probably the one, what should I call? Come, do you have two boats or a triangle relationship? There is a feeling that you are a bad woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annies looked up again to look at the vents . Still no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't regret the life I have experienced. I don't regret everything I have experienced. This is enough."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every wound in her body is soaked in pain, and each muscle is hollowed out by fatigue. She has consumed too much magic and strength, and now she is waiting purely by the last will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because, I have proven the answer I want to know the most. The fate does not exist, we can have a better future. Even the wings of a butterfly Fanning may also bring storms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie carefully helped the door to wipe the tears on the other cheek, then clenched his necklace , made up his mind. She believes that Bonnie will finish the deadline and she does not have to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't cry, my hero. No matter how others think about you, you are my hero. You will be my hero, always. Always Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered a lot of things. Future, past, present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will see you again in Intre, and will definitely. If something goes wrong, I will definitely not forgive your embarrassment. Leiden?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She called his name, opposite him, and then pressed his finger on the sapphire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With all my remaining magic, transfer memories!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic and Anne other The magic is different, there is no gorgeous scene, it is sadly low-key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of her body just gradually became a crystal powder from the lower body and disappeared into the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning is the waist, then the chest, then the smile, and finally the finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powder looks like the early frost in late autumn, or the first snow of the Shennar Festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frost spreads out in the wind, falls quietly, and falls to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cream left by Anne is also blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sapphire was dyed by these frosting powders, reflecting the bright blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support of the finger was lost and it began to fall freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was moved to the right hand, blocking the blue light pendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that is not the proof of the soul, but the proof of memory. It contains all the memories of Anne Seifer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that there were a few more red filaments in the original sky blue gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to laugh at the end? Do you want to, Annie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In addition, left in his hands, there is only one Intrepid military uniform without sleeves, and the ragged red military uniform looks like a sleeveless jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jacket she left was also red, painted with deep red stains, like a camouflage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just stood there, his hands kept in the previous position, as if he were still holding a girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
