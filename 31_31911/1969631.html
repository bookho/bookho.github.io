They crossed one after another moat, one after another, and one market after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are every equestrian knights dressed in green uniforms who are skilled in equestrian. They are six people who guard the central two. They are not quick, not slow. In the middle of the two people wearing a command sword at the waist, the opposite is true. A handle from the hilt to the scabbard is extremely beautiful, while the other handle is unremarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish them to take the East Gate, more than an hour later than the scheduled arrival time. Like them, their enemies also fled all night, and on the way they met the guards of the government forces and had to detour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens who released the goodness of the capital looked at the soldiers and gave way to the road in panic; those who were not so kind were not so happy, but they had to give way . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "God. I never thought about the Françor who claimed to be the 'real Fegotar'; Rasta would follow a group of laws The people are so intimately mixed together." A poor citizen drives the carriage and uses a tone of tone. "If this mission is successful, I must laugh at him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Do you want to do it?" asked another unwell citizen near him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Oh, no, of course not. You saw it, the guy and the sword: that is the 'honor', not the broken thing on me. Even I have the 'courage' of the Guardian Knights, and I may not be able to do much better than him. He doesn't dare to do it, we still forget it." The first citizen watched the squad cavalry go away, "we still Acting as planned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing them has never shot, just following their route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown horse continued to gallop, rushed across the central square, crossed the bustling trade street, followed the sun at 10 o'clock in the morning and stopped at the Supreme Court. In front of the door. They rolled over and stalked in the chaotic, bustling square, where the groom and the carriages gave them a way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Those people are Betsy... Are we going in?" In a black carriage not far away, it is nominally owned by Kengler. The first state secretary of the highest power looked at the car and shyly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish a hat that sits next to him with a long green hair and a glamorous woman who is beyond the ordinary: "No, it's not the time." Wait a minute, don't be afraid. You are a famous eloquent, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing her eyes can melt the strongest fear in the heart. Chase; Brighton swallowed his mouth and suppressed the evil thoughts in his heart. No wonder the woman in front can be the mistress of "Machiavelli"... Of course, he does not know that his emotions are under the direct control of the woman in front of him. In front of this woman, she likes to use the stupidity of the man's instinct to serve her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no release in the final release, just jumped from the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, the adjutant of the third division, the owner of the sword "Justice" Robert; Ai Lieutenant Colonel did not suffer any interference, quietly pushed away The door to the Supreme Court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the court debate has entered a dull tug of war, the law of both parties The consultants are busy searching for textbooks for eloquence. It is a bit unclear to say "both sides" because the two speakers are standing on the same side of the complaint. Almost as they came in, Admiral Betsy, who had been glaring at the door with his eyes, suddenly stood up and interrupted the defender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Sorry, the judge, the prosecutor asked to call a new witness. They arrived late, but they were not late."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the release of the three ** officials, they agreed to this request. "Please submit the name of the witness to the court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "My adjutant, the person who was taken away, Robert; Ayr Lieutenant Colonel; witnessed at close range The outstanding gendarmerie of the rebel internal decision, Thain; Major Constance; and our most important prisoner of war last night, the notorious liberation of the knight, the empire came to negotiate the reception of the Secretary of the Republic of the Concord - Frasol; Russ Sir Ta. I believe that these witnesses are enough to prove a crime. A crime that should not be forgotten and should not be ignored. We must not let a sinner, but not a good person."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judges were released but the judges were not infected by this emotion. A judge raised the question: "That... Sir Rasta is an imperial citizen. I think we need to ask the pastor of the liar to come over? After all, we need to know the authenticity of the witness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Also, if you bring weapons to court, it is too disrespectful to the court. Please hand over the weapons to the guards on the side." Another judge Added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Nothing is necessary." It is not Rasta who is defending the argument, but Robert. "The sword has an oath. The lie is an act of no honor. Once you lie, it is impossible to pick up the sword. It is more reliable than lie detection. If he tries to break through this sword, I will use mine. "Swords defend the princes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "That's it. Please ask the prosecution witness to accept the inquiry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Rasta began with a high-handed sword and walked into the witness stand, and Robert followed him. The performance of the Liberation Knight is as impeccable as the great knights in the legend: perhaps he does not want to shame his motherland and bloodlines in front of these southerners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published General Bezi began his inquiry: "Where were you last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Released "Fottle Fort, Commander Marshal Govar." The Cavaliers replied. His hand was pressed against the hilt, and the sword was three-pointed from the sheath, and the golden light sprang from the short blade. I don't know if his courage nourishes the sword, or the sword has raised his courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "What are you doing there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Defense Fort." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "No, I am asking if you are sending messages for the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published And it started. Rasta slowly nodded: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post "What news? What are you going to get from the defendant?" Betsy’s question core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "We hope that the people of Ruhrlock have the right to choose their own path, for which we will discuss with Margaret Govar. The Empire will guarantee the people of the Republic of Autonomy and freedom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of a loud buzz from the auditorium and the jury. The hatred of the Cochrane monarchy is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and citizens feel indignant when they hear these people talking about freedom. "It is the former Marshal of Govar." The judge on the left corrected. But Betsy shook his head and said that he did not mind symmetrical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "So, your expectation is to split Juqlock from the land of the Republic into the land of the Empire?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clever way to publish Bezi’s inquiry skills. Whether his question directly refers to the provisions of treason. He used expectations instead of purpose, in order to prevent Rasta from moving out the text to bypass the answer. The knight hesitated and found that he had no way to deny the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "...Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Is the defendant rejecting the proposal?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish Rasta to squeeze the answer from the teeth." "...no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released the fifth time. The citizens who watched the audience began to shout "treason", the judge on the left kept knocking on the table, Wiener; Betsy enjoyed his initial victory with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Very good. The last question, last night you were at the North Shore Fortress, how many soldiers of the Southwest Army have you seen?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Conti and Klad’s pupils suddenly contracted. This French Muse is not satisfied with the current victory, he wants the highest command of the Free Army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released "I am going to intercept Robert's troops, and a Southwest Army has not seen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publishing "My question is over. Thank you for your cooperation. Then, judges, I think I can already make an accusation. Gowar is a careerist. He is trying to become an official of the Empire by trampling on our freedom!" And these soldiers who claim to be my companions? They are excusing the man by playing with justice! I want to accuse the accused of treason!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of "all the defendants have done is to betray our great country. And you have seen, people around me, even sheltering him! Clad; Lopez! Conti; Fox teacher! You are in the face of maintenance Can this divided army and this divided republic be sold out even if it is fair? If he claims that he can represent the public opinion of the Republic of Juran, then please tell us where the Rusher people are?! What you say, Where are the people who are hurting?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;release a dramatic pause. People seize this opportunity to think and decide their next move. The Pharisees in the jury were originally on his side, and the Yimeiyan and Intres were also shaking. Klad was strikingly on the table, frowning, thinking about when to use the last killer to save his condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was then a door that was pushed open, accompanied by a loud, majestic, medium-filled voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Is the judge to find the people of Ruhrlock? Then, I-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man was released and said his first sentence in the most appropriate gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Representatives--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of all released are directed at the door. The bright sun in the afternoon was shot through the two open doors, and the man stood in the light. He looks good and stands in a neat dress, just like a real big politician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish the will of the entire Confucian electorate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Who are you? Interfering with the trial It is contempt of court!" The judge on the right shouted loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published the representative of the Ruhrlock people, Chase, the first secretary of state of the Republic; Brighton. Because someone asked him to speak, the injured people appeared in court, I It’s coming. Can this be seen as a legitimate witness call?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing this identity, the audience of the audience stood up almost at the same time, crowded, Pushing it, looking at the door in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first State Secretary was issued, and the term used after two hundred and fifty years was the "President of the Republic." The elected president of the Syrian Arab Republic, the person in charge of daily government affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I risked my great life to come here to refute the accusation of treason. Before you accuse us, please remember: Ruhrock I don't want to leave the federation, but they have the freedom to leave the federation. Our constitution stipulates treason, but does not stipulate that the provinces and republics that are free to join the federation do not have the right to sever. The final result may depend entirely on the outcome of today's trial." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La Lily; Maggie smiled in the carriage, shouting through the mouth of the man who was manipulating. Her will casts on him, giving him courage and wisdom. The fight is not over: she will get back to what was lost on the battlefield - at least part of it. Fortnight's nightmare just wiped out some of the possibilities, not all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released "Radz; Marshal Govar may have been out of support from you, but he is still the Marshal and Commander-in-Chief of the Ruhrlock Government. I will Will stand with our commander-in-chief. For judges and prosecutors, please ask questions. He does not have treason, because one in four citizens still supports him; if you want to prove that he is treason, you need to come up with a constitution. To prove that we are all treason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Released Chase to take a big step and walk towards the dock. The expression on his face was a bit sluggish, but his eyes were full of confidence and he was afraid to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judges whispered and discussed the new possibilities. constitution. If we want to discuss whether the Ruhrucks have the right to liberate from a constitutional point of view, it is impossible for these grand jury members to decide. The Constitution is a serious issue that requires the court to interpret the law and get the approval of more than two-thirds of the members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Clade stood up and hit the railroad: "Mr. Brighton makes sense. The crime of treason can only be established when there is unmistakable evidence of treason." Unless we can prove that Kengler’s government is an illegal government, we can confirm his treason; the Constitution does not state that an independent republic cannot separate itself from the federal government. Our constitution only confirms the establishment of the federation. The conditions do not establish the conditions for the federal disintegration. We are all here waiting for your judicial interpretation of the action of 'departing from the federation'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Released "In view of the fact that the Constitution does not record the issue of 'disengagement from the Federation', we will temporarily adjourn today! We will reopen the court tomorrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Release the last big game Hey. The lawmakers shouted and tried to clean up the situation. The citizens who were attending the audience also shouted indignantly, some supported Ruhrlock, some supported Fay's, and everything was chaotic. The great men got up and left, and the guards guarded the prosecutor and the accused to leave the Supreme Court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Do you think this trial is too confusing? I think something will happen. Do you want to send a message to Miss Anne?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "It shouldn't be necessary yet. Although there have been so many unexpected incidents, it is still under control. Since even the people of Ruhrock have appeared, they will take a break today. Court, let's save some."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two intelligence officers who released the pure gold looked at it all and whispered. They did not use the communication buoy in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "The talent went in for twenty minutes and it was adjourned... It seems that Machia Veri’s left and right hands didn’t disappoint us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish “Let’s do it? Cardinal adult. I hope your magic is not in this long Throw in the world travel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "to each other, Isaac. Are you in your pocket of apples?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Don't worry, Uncle. We only have one chance, because there is an anti-magic enchantment that can be activated at any time in the Supreme Court. Wait a second, wait for the best opportunity." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published on the edge of the square, a pair of uncles whispered. They are not far from Lily's carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I think we need to talk to the mysterious lady in the carriage. She seems to have some hard-to-describe power." Jeter Worried, "That is different from any magic recorded in our books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I don’t think so. If only Chase can Give it a try, but that woman... I think it’s dangerous.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary director of the Southern Bureau suddenly stopped here because he saw people already Two or three times from the Supreme Court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to be released is a large number of media reporters who are busy writing the manuscript. It was followed by the civilians who wanted to go home to eat. These people circumvented the square filled with carriages, called the rental carriage or simply walked home. After that, the members of the parliament came out in twos and threes, rushed to their carriages, and then let the grooms sip in the chaos to find the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Visa Rasta was the first of the defendants to leave the court. He looked up and judged to be near noon according to the position of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release of Lieutenant Colonel Robert and his superiors whispered in the distance. The two generals Lopez and Betsy had a bit of a dispute, but in the end it seemed that a consensus had been reached. Robert, who was still so serious, approached the accused and conveyed the conclusions to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "We will arrange you, Mr. Govar and Lord Brighton in the hotel of the Gendarmerie Headquarters. There is a neutralist... forget it, say nothing about this. In short, I am afraid you have to stay here for a few more days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "He is also sincere. If this guy is not a Frenchman, it is true. Maybe it’s a good knight-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lasta is thinking with regret, looking at the parking lot and asking, "What about our horse?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Oh, those horses have been temporarily placed in the camp of the defending army. The main force and prisoners on the walk will arrive in the afternoon, and then bring them with them." It’s good to go back to the camp. The three generals all brought a special guard car, hey, there.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribute the “black ones?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Yes, each can sit four people, three of you and me, one of Betsy, one of Lord Lopez "Robert has just turned out from the court to the former marshal," Let's go, sir "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Published "Is there an Apple businessman who has fallen here? Wait a minute... Apple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published some memories of the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "It seems to have been heard at the Imperial University when listening to the latest magic seminars, what is the catalyst of the spell..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release is recalling, his feet suddenly light, just like walking empty. The ground suddenly disappeared and replaced with a quick fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not a fall, but...flying? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release is not, nor is it flying. Everyone is falling in the direction of the sky! Fall "fall"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lasta is struggling, twisting his limbs and trying to maintain his balance. The lingering glimpse of his eyes.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish Apple. Apple is flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the screams of countless people, he was keenly aware that all the fall was led by Apple, and the apples attracted all the things like a solid ground. object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing him thinks. This year, he heard a secret report of the latest magic. The owner of the paper was hailed as "a rare genius in a century," because he saw the apple falling down and invented a powerful magic that was at least seven to eight levels...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Starting Anti-Magic Array!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know who is yelling. At the bottom of the parliament building is a huge circular defense array, the last absolute line of defense against magical attacks, found in almost all important buildings. "Anti-magic" is different from "resis". The former will absolutely prohibit the use of all magic, while the latter will only use the power of magic to defend other magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;There is absolutely no mental power to run in the anti-magic array - even if God is coming.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "No, not enough! Robert! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release faintly can be heard by General Betsy. The Liberation Knight is alert and hurriedly huddled in the air. He has not waited for him to complete the landing preparation. Robert's sword has rubbed the scabbard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Justice" out of the sheath, pointing to the sky!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The invisible dispelling magic cone was sent out from his sword front, covering all the apples outside the range of the anti-magic array. Wherever the magic was scattered, gravity immediately returned to normal, and people, horses, and carriages fell back to the ground. ―<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Too late!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published - from almost the same height as the Supreme Court!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lasta closed his eyes, listening to the surrounding winds and miserable Call, waiting for the landing that is terrible.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "feather fall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publish more than one spell to launch. Fortunately, he did not really fall to the ground. Several guards of the guards used protective magic to rescue these important people from the deadly fall; unfortunately, the rest The average person is not so lucky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish all things almost underground at the same time. Countless horses have broken bones and died of death; those ordinary soldiers and innocent people The groom was also affected. In front of Rasta, there was a French soldier who was on the left shoulder and was crying in pain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish Anxious to rescue comrades! Start the court wall magic, protect all entrances with iron walls! The enemy is likely to launch an attack immediately Survivors immediately alert ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; dressed in blue uniforms issued a young lieutenant colonel commanded loudly, started the Supreme Court buried near the fortifications magic. But before he finished the spell, a carriage on his right hand was broken into pieces in the explosion. Countless shrapnel flew to the lieutenant colonel, and he screamed and slammed his right arm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
