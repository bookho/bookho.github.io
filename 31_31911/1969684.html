Central District 1<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav? Hugh? Coman I’s eyes crossed the square and landed on the enemy’s array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the first imperial emperor to set foot on this land for the past 100 years. Now his army is trying to suppress the Free Army guarding it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the normal standards, the situation at this time should be the leader of the Free Army, and the leading advantage is not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-winged cavalry of the emperor was surrounded by hundreds of infantry and could be devastated at any time. Although the central government broke through quickly, it was delayed by the new magic of the other commander and failed to reach a further breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, the emperor heard the call of the god of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did he shake? Why did he use a gun instead of magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one wearing The commander of the Southern Army of the Excellence Chapter hesitated at the moment of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hesitation of this moment, the foreign minister in front of him did not notice that the emperor at the other end of the battlefield noticed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav swept the array of the South Army again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once judged, the unreasonable place of this array becomes more and more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no magic officers, no artillery, and there are a lot of things missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not an elite force, but a temporary entanglement. Can I feel this alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly sensed a similar idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor turned his head and met with Danica’s gaze; the girl’s shoulder trembled and hurriedly stared down at the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is the same suspicion in your heart, Miss Weilun." The emperor's mouth flashed a sneer. "My generals did not see it. As long as things There is a slight difference from the common sense, they can't see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 can't hide, just nodded: "I want to... the enemy It should be a reserve team that is temporarily put together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it can only be temporarily mobilized! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 is very sure, Naimen? Soledon was just an ordinary captain a day ago. Still not the captain of the Lenny Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His troops are in the Western Army, not here. The troops he is commanding must have been temporarily pulled, without training, without coordination, without preparation, and without command. It is impossible to have one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor nodded and determined his judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the way it was. I was almost stunned by the 'excellence chapter' and he actually fooled all my generals."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He plucked a jewel at the top of the scepter named "Power." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fegotaqing, Eagle Wing! Don't care about the 'excellence chapter', dispel his troops! The rest, come with me, all Assault! This is me, the order of all the Koman emperors, Gustav Hugh Coleman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing this order, the Earl of the Eagle Wing, who was fighting with the other commander, just glanced back, and the attack of the sword of the name "benevolent" in his hand kept going, frowning and whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a mess. Regardless of the other’s commander?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Minister Loren? The prince of Feng? Figota is a big change. With a wave of his hand, he spread the troops around him to the two wings, and he turned and rushed toward the rear. From his vigorous pace, he did not see that the Duke was over 60 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Total assault? Your majesty, this is not feasible, it is too dangerous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is anxious The line of sight crossed the square and was cast on several guards around the emperor. He has repeatedly confessed that he must stop the emperor from personally taking risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of the two Guards seized the emperor’s arms: "Your Majesty! The Minister of Military Affairs said that you should not expose you to the enemy’s firepower. Next..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav’s arm slammed, and the two guards were pushed away by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn't it just a few new magics? Any new magic must have its weaknesses, and Fegota must be able to figure out a solution soon. The team and the magician team, keep up with my steps!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor firmly moved forward and crossed the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the pace is still limping, the speed is amazingly fast. In front of his pace, it is the national army company farthest from the left wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't fight, don't call back, make a total attack! Break ahead! Breakthrough! Breakthrough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the people, the Musketeers, the magicians, the pastors, have followed. People walked through the square in a scattered formation, trying to meet the infantry team that was fighting in front. Renee hesitated and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorryton really should have nothing in his hand, but is it really that simple?" Somewhere in her heart, she was asking herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s attention is focused on the array of free agents in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one noticed that there were more groups of dimly lit fires downstairs in the North Parliament Building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fire, fill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the flames that just lit up, The commander of the Free Army artillery ordered the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is looking at the light shining in the direction of the parliament building. Whispered. He stepped back three steps and picked up a rifle with a bayonet from the ground, barely blocking the sword of the Earl of the Eagle Wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The emperor is finally here. If this continues, my new magic will be seen through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Beyond the worst expectations, worse than the best expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right into the door while calculating the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred and twenty steps, one hundred and ten steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor entered the square without any shelter under the magician's arch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t find enough magic officers to be true...but it doesn’t mean he doesn’t have artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the capital of the free nations, before the joint parliament building! How can there be no artillery arches in this building? Upon discovering that the company that guarded the parliament building had an artillery platoon, the door did not hesitate to ambush them downstairs in the parliament building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the front of all the infantry to raise fire, but also to confuse the enemy's judgment. He did not extinguish all the lights around him, but lit up every five miles to form the illusion of no ambush in the range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve pounds of guns filled with double propellant and double No. 2 grape shots, and fired at the center of the square!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery platoon leader no longer masks, he uses Gestures and flare signals give orders to all artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire artillery platoon has a total of six guns. The 12-pound salute in the five-door council building, plus an 18-pound naval cannon that was pulled from the museum and used in the third war. In order to drag the slightly old behemoth to the downstairs of the parliament building, the officers of the Freedom Army spent a lot of effort and spent a lot of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five firemen are now firing. Although nominally a salute, the maintenance and quality of the five guns is beyond doubt. Even if they are extremely damaging to the artillery, they can still shoot normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The default target for all artillery is the center of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud gunpowder explosion echoed, making the sharp whistling of the imperial wizard's alert magic seem useless. Even without that magic, everyone knows that the enemy artillery is on fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy shelling! Organizational defense!" "Stone wall!" "Explosion-proof shield!" "Deflection force field!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor stopped and began to prepare for defense magic. He made a wide range of storms in the air in front of him, praising the other's commander: "Grape smash. He intended to target the most defensive caster team from the beginning."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shells that contain multiple smaller ammunition in a single shell are called shotguns. According to the size of the lead particles used in the shots, the larger shells of the lead pellets are specifically called grape bombs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small lead shot means that each shell contains more ammunition and can cover the target area more and more densely, but at the same time it is easy to be wide-area Defensive magic resists; the size of the large grape lead is much less, it can take chances to cause damage, but it is easier to penetrate all kinds of armor and defensive magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the former is effective against light infantry and cavalry that lacks defense, while the latter is a weapon against a diverse team of defensive warriors such as heavy warriors and magicians. . For the No. 2 12-pound grape bomb used by the Free Army, the second said that each lead is half a pound, and there are twenty-one lead in each twelve-pound shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this round of shelling, there were two hundred and ten half-pound lead shots in the 12-round 12-pound grape shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hundred large lead shots are enough to penetrate most of the magical stone walls and the holy shield, and the effect of the bias field will also be random due to the bullets. The reason was reduced to a minimum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detachment of the emperor is only a total of forty or fifty people, almost all of them are exposed to the threat of shotguns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The munitions wrapped in iron mesh rubbed the air, giving off a squeaky ballistic sound. Most of the shells disintegrated in the air, but the quality of a few barbed wire was unstable and blasted until it hit the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several aristocrats and court mages who were focusing on the air defense magic, and they were caught off the hook by the large lead shot that slanted from below. in. Half-pound lead shots have little penetrating power, but those hit by them are certainly dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pumice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonica has long since squatted and read a Spell. All the tiles in front of her were smashed by this spell. Within ten meters of her, these tiles floating in the low air formed a low barrier, enclosing the emperor and several of his guards. Several shots of plumbs flying across the ground hit the floor tiles and were trapped outside the barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor saw this strange magic and immediately knew who put it: "You are familiar with this shell, Miss Weilun."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenica just nodded. From the Figotas, she knows that the empire's grape shots are very low, and even if they are mostly assigned to the navy, the average soldier is not familiar with the performance of the grape. Even the Figota soldiers who often fought with the South Army saw only paper-shell grape bombs or expensive magic-guided grape bombs. They didn't know much about this random injury shells wrapped with wire mesh... Of course, this is also related to the fact that the empire cannot produce iron wire on a large scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, she heard a loud and gloomy explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the parliament building, the artillery commander personally lit the door The fire line of the 18-pound heavy artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery is an old model of naval gun, and the ammunition is not. The other artillery pieces were all grape bombs, and only one 18-pound gun was filled with a broken magic bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long archery era, people have created magical bows and magic arrows that are amazing in number and variety. After entering the age of firearms, these efforts were of course transferred to the firearms. The magicians have found that these weapons are a much better magical vehicle, in addition to the major drawback of high-speed friction and explosions that can damage the effects of certain spells. The magic that was originally used to accelerate the advancement of the arrow is replaced by chemical energy and can be used in other directions - such as breaking through defensive magic and obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Silver Star" Mithril is the most outstanding achievement in this respect. This month the Parliament is discussing the possibility of making it on a large scale. The bomb weighs 19 pounds and a half and can be fired with 18-pound guns of all types. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After removing the outer layer of high-density Mithril material, the combat part has a net weight of 14 pounds. Last year, it entered the experimental stage of installation, which is the most advanced in the entire civilized world. One of the magic weapons, the cost per hair is almost the top half of the artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is designed to deal with the latest active volley reaction magic from earthen walls, stone walls, and force fields. The warhead also has a degree of automatic guidance. You can offset the location with the highest density of magic in the lineup. In the case of the Army, it is a military mage. In the case of the Navy, it is a navigation mage. Therefore, the Free Land Navy has high hopes for such artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among all the resources that Nami Soleton barely put together, only this experimental ammunition could break the mighty emperor. This shell bombed the shiny silver trail, and it was directly tied to the center of the floor tile ring! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to hit. It is said that even a few top casters can't defend against this shell."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is so praying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loren von Figota’s Minister of Military Affairs stopped and his face became iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! Quickly open that thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gustav Emperor does not Defense, do not evade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just stepped back half a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is his card."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor holds the end of the staff with both hands, side Passing over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scepter "power" in his hand points vertically to the sky-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic above is fully expanded , formed a giant network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's try it out. Strengthen my strength and speed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The trajectory of the heavy-duty devil's shells is reflected in the eyes of the emperor, and every point that passes through is clearly visible. The talent of dynamic vision is naturally engraved in the blood of the Keman family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer the projectile is, the more it seems to be constantly adjusting the trajectory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding Mithril shell began to fall off, neutralizing the surrounding defensive magic, and revealing a solid and sharp cone-shaped grenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor took a deep breath and then narrowed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shell fell, squatting in the middle of the stone ring-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to describe Gus in language The quickness and power of Taft's movements. Several guards were trying in vain to try to interfere with the shell with magic, and only Yanika saw the trajectory of "power." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible net caught the broken magic shell. I haven't waited for the magic on the shell to play a role in detonating, and it was directly smashed out by the emperor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shell flew back and slammed into the heights of the parliament building and exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a stunned look at the two pillars on the facade of the parliament building being smashed by this violent explosion and then slowly falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustav? Hugh? Coleman actually returned a cannonball back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, using a sword to slash bullets is nothing. Almost everyone who sees is thinking about the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood of the royal family...is too outrageous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the soldiers of the Free Army Said that this psychological impact is much greater. No wonder those aristocrats and magicians in the north should be loyal to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, it’s a bit off, it should have been a blow to the middle of the parliament building. The track of this shell is a bit strange."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav put away the "power" with his left hand, and pushed the shoulders that had been dislocated because of the powerful momentum to the position without any problems. He turned to the stunned Jonica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is a magic-guided cannonball... that means your magic power is already strong enough to interfere with its trajectory. In so many royal mages and In the middle of the priest, this is a remarkable achievement, Miss Duke. With such magic, you will eventually find a place among my subjects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor hopes again The enemy's artillery position. Already a squad has rushed over, at least for a short time, the artillery platoon could not be fired again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, continue with the general assault! Destroy them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;****** ***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the emperor!" shouted through the battlefield. The battle continued until now, and probably half of Lenny knew that the enemy had advanced to the first zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the guns are smashing, three rows of rapid shots!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred empire's muskets and The magician team fired all the way. The low-pitched curse and the roar of the fire rope rang, and the sharp start-ups came one after another, but then the explosion and the bullets broke into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the excellent chapter? Captain Solerton kept picking up the rifle with a bayonet from the ground, and the more he retreated, the more he retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes squatted from time to time, trying to find a way to retreat for himself and his troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so bad, it’s all over here. Eight company, two battalions, the most powerful regular army reserve team within the second wall. Lenny said that there are 100,000 defenders, but at least 70,000 of the 100,000 garrisons confronted the enemy on the third and fourth walls, and most of the remaining 30,000 were in the battlefield hospitals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emperor... In this hundred-year war, we have been able to kill several such monsters. The former soldiers of the Free Army are really amazing. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't win. I can't win from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the door is painstakingly trying to concentrate on the strength of one's own side, to lure the emperor's batch into combat power, to lure different units into different directions for siege, just to Solve the emperor. After solving the emperor, he can naturally escape with his own defensive magic, which is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the result of the concentration of all artillery firepower is nothing more than adding a little bruise to the pure royal blood. Six guns and the latest heavy-duty devil bombs are also worthless in front of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go forward! Break the enemy wings!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl in front of him did not give him any chance to retreat. He can't organize a retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, Eagle Wing! How long will you have to drag!" The grumpy old duke turned back to the front line and shouted. "You can't do it." Look at your troops! Leave him alone, the troops are not directly directed by him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five minutes! I know the weakness of this new magic - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the old duke interrupted him directly." "Mage! Stone wall technique, separate these two people! What is weak, I have already judged it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two court mages immediately read the mantra Use two stone walls to separate Nanimen and Kewei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign minister slammed the corner of the stone wall with a sword and turned to look for the theory of the Duke of Figota. Naimeng immediately seized the opportunity to escape to his troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't it possible to use magic on its own initiative! With such a powerful defense and dispelling magic, there is no magic that can overflow from it -" the old duke said half, suddenly Woke up, "Stone wall surgery! Surround the 'excellence chapter'! Before he withdraws!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not hear this sentence. At that time, he was anxiously watching his right wing, the right wing was in jeopardy, and he seemed to be broken at any time, then he was escorted and annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All troops pay attention, concentrate on the left wing, wait for an opportunity to enter the street battle-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his A stone wall suddenly appeared in front of him. His shoulder slammed into the stone wall, and he rushed to the left with pain, trying to get around this magic stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is another stone wall. Two, three, four. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was found to be surrounded by a cell made up of stone walls. For a magician, this situation should have been easy to solve, even if the new Master in the first stage will not be stumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he heard the joyful and somewhat crazy laughter of the Earl of the Eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, so he will lift that damn new defensive magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The door-to-door movement froze, and the word "death" crossed his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He want to try? Does he dare to try? In any case, the owner of the "kind" will act faster than him. He didn't have time to make up the defensive magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain this magic, he can at least survive. The magic has been lifted, and there may be a chance to escape, but it is more likely to die directly here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be other options. I can always figure out what other ways to come. Naimen said to himself, fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time it seems that all the ideas are exhausted. There is only one choice in front of him: death now, or waiting to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated until the gunshots, mantras, and killings of the outside slowly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cheers were heard... This could not be the victory of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be all over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen picked up his own gun. Now to dispel the magic, use this gun to shoot at the head, it seems to be a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but don't want to die. The more veterans, the more they don't want to die. They even feel that they will not die. In his mentality, he is already a veteran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some conversation outside, and getting closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Escaped more than a hundred people. Most of them were left here by us. After five minutes, we can leave and kneel down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone smashed the stone wall with magic. There are many torches on the outside, and the glare is as white as it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their midst, it is the emperor. Standing in the first place of his left hand is the old duke. He didn't see Yanika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke asked him: "The resistance of your army is over. You are the commander of this army. Name?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be the military minister Fergota, who is thinking. "I, I, I am..." He wanted to answer, but his tongue was like a knot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Fegota mistakenly thought that he was going to say an impassioned speech, and immediately interrupted: "Don’t say long story, we have a tight time. Surrender or not Surrender? The first person who abandoned the dark can still be treated preferentially..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff in the hands of the emperor suddenly slammed on the ground and interrupted the words of the Minister of Military Affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pause. I have objection, Fegotaqing. I don't accept surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty?" The Military Minister asked strangely, "He is a chapter of excellence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. I can leave in five minutes, right." The emperor took a step forward and looked at the captain in front of him. "Do you feel that you lost a lot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negman? Soledon looked at the emperor. This man is the biggest power in the north, a humanoid monster, a tyrant. This is true from the perspective of combat effectiveness. Not handsome, but looks very powerful and can make a deep impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You feel that you have done your best for victory. The final loss is because our strength is too strong, and bad luck. You feel that your command can't be It’s a good thing to say, so you’ve stayed here, so you’ll want to try your luck and see if you can surrender.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open, think Say "I don't surrender," but I can't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not like this. It's your greed for credit, pushing your country to a dead end. If you succeed, you can end the war and be able to use the smallest The loss is the biggest effect. You will become a hero and write your name in the history book in bold. Can you estimate your chances of success? Have you considered the consequences of your failure, the chapter of excellence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor looked at him coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been busy taking risks without knowing the conditions. I am here because I have confidence in my combat effectiveness. Do you have it? You are busy retreating, Rather than procrastinating time, it proves that you have no backup. The formal reserve power of the entire Lenny Army is here? Now, from here to the East Third District, there is only one gate of the Lenny Army. You are gambling. Not only gambling with your own life, but also gambling with the national football of the whole country. You personally put the entire reserve force of the Lenny Army on the table, and then lost a light."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your self-assertion to bring the reserve team together and give us a net. If these troops are scattered in the city, we can't safely destroy your command center. You should be aware that your success rate may be Only one-fifth, even one-tenth, one-twentieth. You are taking the risk of taking your country for your personal honor." Gustav looked around the ministers and emphasized it word by word. "And I don't need a gambler. I do not accept your surrender "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; resistant door head cold sweat oozes shed. His teeth trembled, but he didn't know how to refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is. If these units are not broken, the interception effect may be better when the emperor tries to win the door. Although it also carries a very high risk, but he is subconsciously preferring this more direct direct interception plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the side of the Eagle Wings who made an objection: “If you kill a serious 'excellence chapter’ on the battlefield, you can shock the rebels, but kill Captive... There are too many people who know it now, and it is impossible to keep it secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, after all, the opponent who had fought with him, was so degraded by the emperor, The Earl's subconscious also felt a little bit dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who said to kill him? I like his enemies like this. I like the enemy who just used it for myself. Especially, I can’t judge the strength of the enemy and the army. I like the enemy who fights with great combat plans. If all my enemies are like this, it would be too easy to destroy such an army. Some people think that they can overcome the power gap with their little cleverness. People think that they can ignore the order of the world by making flexible excuses. I like such enemies, I like them very much, but I don't like such companions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not at all. I want the soldiers of the rebel army to see what kind of people they have issued to the chapter of excellence." The emperor concluded that "the exquisite chapter of excellence" is actually a waste that cannot be gathered even by fireballs. This is also an exaggeration. He also uses his motherland as a bargaining chip for his future. When you hear these things, there should be many people who lose confidence in the future of the South Army. Their most advanced medals will become A joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negeri saw his future. What kind of future is that? He quietly pressed his hand on his gun and lifted the defensive magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe death is still a better choice. Compared to surrender, humiliation, life is better than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this moment, the emperor sneered. He has been waiting for this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you understand. I command you, stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a great spirit Power invaded the mind of the door to lose the willpower. For a mind with a strong belief that can use magic, it is only at the edge of the collapse that it is possible to be controlled by the spirit control magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The order begins. You will give up all the thoughts of resistance and the idea of ​​escape. You will move in the direction of our army and try to be a prisoner. These are The willingness in the depths of your mind does not affect you to deal with other southerners. You will always want to live before you actually enter the prison camp. The emperor looked at the pocket watch. "It takes exactly five minutes for the troops to leave." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door is attached to the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move! Move! Move! He yelled at himself in his heart, but it didn't work. The limbs did not move, and did not accept his own orders at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the Empire to surrender," a devilish voice repeated in the ear. Like his own voice, but in fact it is mental control magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to surrender. Wait until the time is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched these emperors rushing to the east and leaving east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow them. Going in the direction of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No resistance, no escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who will save me from this nightmare. No matter who is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is the cry he did not say. No one will hear it. When the spirit control magic acts on a person who will collapse, it is so powerful that even the bishops may not be able to lift this mental control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why, Nana thinks that someone can hear it. This is just a feeling. He has no spare time to think about who heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started to go. Follow the hooves of the emperor and go to the east side of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in that army, the Earl of the Eagle wing also looked at his enemy. The one who went along with him was the old Duke of Figota. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand." The count whispered to the military minister. "Why should you say this? The commander is good and the pace is fast. Just because of youth, There is not enough capacity and experience yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect of staying with him will be better. Fundamentally, the system of traitors is better than killing Their people are much more useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, the old duke no longer speaks, it looks a little sentimental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In our time, ordinary soldiers who seized a medal of excellence can use this military to change to a baron with a formal seal. I have a viscount to borrow. The founder, the one he brought with him killed a seven-segment master's 'excellence chapter'. His camp had more than 800 people, and after that, there were only about 60 people left. As for the chapter of living excellence We haven't caught one. No one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
