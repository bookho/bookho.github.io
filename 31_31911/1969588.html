			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter sun is warm, and it’s so sleepy; for the Lonnie police organization, which is always lazy and inefficient, This is even more a calm afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nearly 3,000 police officers in the city’s 80 police stations and eight military police stations. I am afraid there are 2,500 people who are dozing off. The next one is lazily going to do some "cases" like eating overlord meals, fighting fights, and thieves. The murder case did happen from time to time, but "the police always come slowly after everything is resolved" and "there is always no real murderer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "Lenny Military Police" in the later generations, the "Lenny Military Police" of the military police team is actually only a little better than the police. There is not much difference on the top. In this era, having the police itself is already great: the Lenny Police Headquarters is the first police organization in history. In the Age of Empires, if you want to be fair or seek security, you can only resort to the judges and guards of the emperor; only after losing the emperor’s prestige, the provincial council established the organization maintained by the police and the sheriffs to defend The safety of citizens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four points have passed and the police are ready to go home to rest. The police of this era do not go to work at night. If there is a case, please report it tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咻,咻,咻! One, two, three red fireworks salutes suddenly burst in the air; the hidden magic effect was launched, and the fireworks turned into a cross in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers on duty of the eight military police stations have both widened their eyes. Red? How can it be? ! Red, orange, yellow, blue, green... turned out to be the highest level of alert! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the arsenal, return to the post, get weapons and guns!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哐啷Oh! The arsenal was opened, and the strong-spirited military policemen rushed in and armed with all kinds of weapons that had been dusted for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alert level red! Blockade blockades in various blocks, evacuate the people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗒嗒,嗒despair! The hooves broke through the silence before dusk, and the warnings of the police echoed in the streets of Lenny. Upon hearing this notice, the merchants rushed to the door, and the citizens who were working or working outside had rushed home, and the residents who had no fixed place were hiding in the corner of the street. In accordance with the emergency response plan, the military police blocked all traffic routes throughout the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, what is going on here?" The new team member who entered the team soon asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. Maybe it's a riot, maybe a war, maybe a mutiny, maybe a Warcraft invasion...how is it possible." The middle-aged police officer The backbone is not very sure about the details of the incident. The commanders of the military police are madly running between the headquarters and the branches to determine the details of the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The red alert hasn’t been seen for many years. Last time it was still in the Empire’s siege of Lenny...” The old policeman who is about to retire, It is recalling the glory days of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police and police members who guessed the truth of the alarm, loyal to the order ensured the order in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Of course, this alert is not only visible to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Anne; Sefer stopped at the door of the mansion and looked at the southern sky illuminated by the red cross. "Magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is probably a magical signal cannon, fired by artillery, and made by magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is it launched? Didn't you say that there are still four hours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the south direction, it is not the ring, but also It’s not a parliament building, I don’t know too well.” Bonnie indulged. “However, it’s only slightly inconsistent with the record, it should still be tolerable...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The two whispered into the yard. Leonard; Kakawi still slept on the lounger next to the fountain, and there was no goldfish in the bucket next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seafarers will become like this on the shore? It is still in line with history." The tone of my sister doesn't sound like a confident look. She stood on the platform of the fountain and directed a huge carriage team into the yard. The important staff of the coachman and the "pure gold" branches also came in together, and the quiet courtyard suddenly became bustling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know in advance that there will be this most advanced emergency alert?" Seeing this scene, serving as the Guard Captain Kazmi; Stewart Walk Go to her and ask the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most advanced? Do they use this kind of alert at sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The military ships of the province have such signal guns. However, I am the first to see the red, the navy usually has orange or yellow.” The former pirate captain said with certainty in his own experience, “If yes If it is red, it will definitely block the whole city and martial law."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The whole city is blocked and martial?" This information seems a bit strange...Sister thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the locals in the Guard have just told me that as long as the highest level of alert is issued, the military police will block each block." The city of 'Lenny, is indeed worthy of the name... Wait a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the explanation half, the big pirate suddenly stopped and put his hand to his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a gunshot. The low gunshots of 砰 and ,, from the south, the source of the sound will not be too far."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?" Bonnie frowned and asked, "The building near the south is the military building."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been rolling at sea for so many years, the resolution of the ear is still not a problem. It must be a gunshot." Katzmi smiled - in his smile, with a look of hope? "There may be confusion tonight. I will let the brethren gather together and lose the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really no problem? Will it be a coup in advance? Launched?" After he left, Annie was busy getting to her sister's ear and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the gunshots really came from the ring, we had a big problem." Bonnie; Sefer bit her lip and bite her lip. Shake his head. "I still underestimate Klad after all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" The sister didn't quite understand the two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a coup, but Krad; Lopez arranged preventive measures. History has a little... No, there are some changes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is?" The only listener still doesn't quite understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, if everything follows Klad’s plan, the coup will not happen at all. Although it is a bit cruel to the victims of the coup, For us, as long as the coup does not happen, the history behind it is completely out of control. Ningmen; Hugh; Coman should also disappear into the long river of history... the chance is about 50%."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, what should we do?" At the final conclusion, Anne immediately panicked. Every time she hears the name, she loses her judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s vain to want to block the change of history with manpower... Such negative thoughts flashed in the brain of my sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie took a deep breath and expelled this unhelpful association: "Now, what can be done can make a big mistake. But, we still You can do something to make history try to produce fewer changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red Emergency Alert?!" as a soldier guarding the Fortress mission, looked up Looking at the sky in the south. The huge red cross, which appeared in the sky several times, proved not to be a false shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" "How can there be a highest level of alert?" "Do we have to be in a state of alert?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the soldiers’ arguments, the captain of the Guard’s captain who knew the coup was inside and frowned, and his heart was up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the colonel decided to let the reserve team also enter the garrison state, and strictly prohibit anyone from entering and leaving the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will immediately order!" He ordered the adjutant, "Let the two teams enter the defensive state..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order was only halfway through, and sporadic gunshots suddenly came from the direction of the main entrance of the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the guard changed his face and rushed out the door. At the gate of the ring, he saw an incredible sight: the garrison at the main entrance had already left all the weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing! Defence, defense!" The colonel screamed and ordered the command. "The soldiers will obey the orders. The orders you get should be dead. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the one who participated in the conspiracy, Colonel." A majestic voice rang coldly. "As long as you surrender now, you can get lenient." Handling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colonel cast his eyes on him - he saw two dazzling Venus, and a striking silver cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crad; Lopez! You shouldn't be here, you should be at the station now..." He pulled a pistol from his waist and pointed at the lieutenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be obsessed." Klad; Lopez's lips trembled, his arm flicked, and he didn't know what magic flew out and flew straight to the school. Brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colonel only felt a cool head - an icicle pinned his cap accurately to the back wall. His heart was cold, and the trigger in his hand was actually unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Attacking the sergeant is a three-level felony. A coup is a first-degree felony. If you take the trigger, the crime will definitely not escape. Your The men are very wise, and they don’t fire on the serge... You can do it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad’s analysis is calm and rational, and the colonel can’t find his flaws. . His hand was soft and the gun fell underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's say, Master Ladds; Where is Gowar?" Klad's victory in pursuit - to get the most information, it is necessary to marry the other party's most vulnerable time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still in the office of the President." The colonel muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crader no longer took care of him, immediately took his own guard, rushed straight inside, and left it to the military police team. Along the way, he was at the forefront; when the guard saw the moment of his epaulettes, he used magic to lift their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Office of the President is at the top of the ring. The piano sound is ringing, and Clade hears that it is "Sorrowful Sonata." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gowar’s seniors still like to play the piano..." When he was at the corner of Rennie, it seemed to be December 7th. The memories of the years have passed by in the hearts of middle-aged people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd pushed the door and found that it was locked, and he used a magic to blow up the lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gowar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed in - there was no one, only the piano Repeatedly repeated, playing the first "Sorrow." The window was wide open, the curtains fluttered in the wind, and the room was very cold. The desk calendar on the table was opened, and it was fixed on the "December 7th of the Year of Sadness"; the note column, "Good luck." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The git, it’s still a step later." Clad; Lopez's hand slammed on the desk calendar. In order to capture Govar, he even deliberately postponed the time to issue an alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several explosions coming from outside, and the response police guns of various military police teams were also launched. He went to the window and counted the number of fireworks: a total of eight military and police branches, but only five signals slammed through the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the parliament building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the brain full of fat have patted the table, and the riots disrupted all the agenda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why will there be a sudden increase in vigilance? We have to question the action of the police headquarters today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the instigating lawmakers, Jamie; Rudel hit High-five; this attempt to calm the crowd did not work. He walked a little helplessly to the center of the parliament hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please be quiet. About an hour ago, we lost all contact with the Freedom Division 10th Division, the Lenny Defenders and their commanders. According to intelligence, these troops are Radz; the coup of the upcoming coup of Marshal Govar. Half an hour ago, we issued an emergency alert; now, the police headquarters has lost contact with about one-third of the area, I believe that the defending forces control these areas. This parliament building is definitely one of the important goals of the other side. Therefore, I suggest that you disband in advance today and go to a safe place under the escort of the military police."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone was thrown into the pond, and the waves were immediately spread out in the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Radetz; Govar?! Why did he do this? Is there a reason?" Some members stood up and questioned loudly, "He was not a former Have you saved our country?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I believe Marshal Govar is a patriot, and I believe he will not be emperor in this free country." However, you should know that the Imperial Council was forced to disband by force 13 years ago and rebuilt the emergency cabinet. Why, I don’t know, but some of you must know.” Ludell’s director replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the situation now? Are we safe here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudel hesitated I decided to tell the truth: "The Eastern and Western Districts have already entered a fierce battle. We have lost a lot of links with them. The Southern District is still in our hands. We are attacking the camps of the enemy forces in the Southern Region. Although it cannot be said to be at stake, if Under the main attack of the enemy, these three hundred people can't resist it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like giving testimony to his words, gunshots and explosions are sporadic The ground is ringing in the distance and getting denser. Upon hearing the gunshots, the leaders of several big parties had a bad face. They looked at each other and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please evacuate! Don't give the coup army the opportunity to control the country's power, even a minute!" Rudel called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, the representatives of the party, please respond to the call of the director, and leave the venue." The party leader of the third party, the Federal Party, stood up and said loudly, "Our glorious party can't succumb to the threat of a coup."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The princes of the Equality Party, please leave!" The chairman also stood up and supported. "Please ask the Speaker of the House to announce the meeting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the gunshots outside, after a week of watching, the Speaker of the Parliament and the Liberal Party Chairman finally stood. Get up: "So, I announced that today's agenda is over and dismissed. You are free to leave; but please don't use the national armed forces as personal guards. That should be used in the most important places."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up abruptly and walked out the door with other lawmakers in twos and threes. There were a few members who wanted to say something, but they still held back and walked outside the parliament building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No! We don't leave!" A arrogant voice rang suddenly. "The Free State Joint Parliament is the highest authority of the country. How can it be coup d'état? The military is coerced! The National Justice Party will hold on to the last moment and live up to the expectations of the people! Even when it was besieged by the northerners, the parliament has never retired. How can we give up now!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the coup army will soon be killed!" Rudel reminded. "They are very close to here, and we may have to evacuate." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them come!" The leader of the National Justice Party patted the table and stood up loudly. "We will not recognize the parliament and the government." Will be disbanded by force! Freedom will never yield to force!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes the entire venue quiet for a moment. Then, with the sound of a table, more people stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, the Layken MP of the Equality Party, volunteer to stay here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
