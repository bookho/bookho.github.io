			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xviii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the Kengal election was a farce. Regardless of the ethical standards, the purpose of the two armies that are surrounded by Kengal is unspeakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deran’s agents undermined the Federal Party’s attempt to take power, but Lenny’s politician officers also destroyed the legitimacy of the autonomous party’s regime. Afterwards, the unwilling Freedom Army and the Emperor sneaked into each other's camps and interfered with the election. In this sneak attack and anti-sneak attack, more than half of the Freedom Army's fifth national "tiger" division was captured, while the Imperial Volunteers sacrificed a cardinal equivalent to the imperial marshal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, this huge loss can't afford both sides. When the plots of each other went bankrupt and the conspiracy under the table intensified into a bloody battle on the table, the first reaction of all was to pour the sewage on the opponent and other companions of the other side. At this time, who can get the news first, who can take the initiative in the public opinion war and the liquidation that will come. The same thing, the way different people handle at different times is completely different. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides being a guest of Nami and Annie, the first thing to know about this news is of course Isaac who directed the attack; Newton himself. Sacrifice Cardinal Jeter; Newton is his uncle, and as an elite of the Master Arbitration Association, he also knows the various iconic miracles of the church. This sad news did not affect Isaac’s judgment. He decisively issued an order to retreat while seeing the white light. In order to prevent the opponent's possible pursuit, he used the magic and magical magic to create a phantom, and also specially selected a retreat route to bypass the city of Kengal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fires in the Freedom Camp were extinguished one by one, and the investigators told him that no enemy had chased them. He waited until he confirmed that there would be no followers, and he had time to start grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton’s father died young, and Uncle Jeter was his true father to Isaac. The reason why he was able to enter the Imperial University Arcane Academy was because of the support of the uncle. He quietly took off his glasses and walked in the darkest corner of the team. Several adjutants tried to ask him if the other side of the action was an accident, and he calmly slammed his face. When the scheduled meeting point was reached, he ordered the team to stay for ten minutes, but no one came to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the camp of the Warriors, Newton discovered that Xiu Lan and Frasol were waiting for him at the door of the Iron Cross, even the "Fog Eagle" Major Isis also wore a casual dress and stood beside them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton waved his hand and disbanded the commando on the spot. The junior officers and soldiers dispersed their interest and left the venue to senior officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everyone left, Viscount Rasta walked to Newton and patted him on the shoulder. "I know that you have been hit hard now, but now we really have no time to sorrow. Let's talk about the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton's mouth twitched: "Jie Your special lord has been called by God. We are too young to look at the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people present were not surprised, they have long been from the miracle of advent I know this. Xiu Lan picks up the words: "So, what is Your Royal Highness Olia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would like to say that because of Jeter’s fight, we rescued her... but Unfortunately, we have completely failed. The Free Army does not lack the first-rate casters, but it does not mean that they lack the second and third-rate, even if Jeter is afraid that he will not be able to escort His Highness." Newton replied with a smile, "Myself They almost fell into the trap, and their magical equipment was really terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will it be that Bruto; Luther? He is a senior Protestant pastor. These The progress of Protestantism is really hard to estimate." Itis remembered what he saw in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiu Lan shook his head and opened the subject. "Who is the opponent is no longer important. What is important is how to make a difference now. We have not been able to organize another offensive in the last two days. The main force of the Central Army of the Free Army is in Vodkagrad. We must start in three days and avoid them. Bingfeng. If the emperor knew that his most loved sister was unclear, we all had a big problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the chief guardian knight’s innocent thoughts Rasta ridiculed: "We are already in great trouble now. According to the usual practice, Sid, who is a ghost, will soon appear. Do you remember that he accepted the big cases that occurred during the five years of the Security Ministry? He always comes with people when things get to their worst."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta sneered: "I am not surprised how he did it, but why he did not do it this time. He is a mage with a secret silver emblem! I dare to gamble on all my salary, he is at us. Within a hundred kilometers, there are only more important things that have led him away. I even suspect that the unidentified person today is him. When he discovers our failure, we are finished. Newton can go back to university, Isis You can continue to be a ambush agent. You and I, together with the spies of the security department, have to go to the border post of the Yongshuang Plain for a few years. There are not many meat distributions. Let's have two hunting points for the winter wolf and frost. The giants eat, oh, and fight the barbarians. It is said that 1,500 barbarians can exchange a permanent frost garrison medal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cold joke caused A serious cold spot. Everyone was silent and looked at each other in an embarrassing way. In the end, Isis smiled and broke the suffocating air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only a report on the truth, and the result is how to listen to it. Can you always call Renee to pretend that the princess is still here?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more unspeakable than a joke is two jokes. People felt a chill of bones, and only Newton suddenly opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute. Why not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three heard this sentence The reaction is like seeing a 12-pound shell in front of you. Rasta touched his nose with a weird expression on his face. "Hey! Isaac, are you serious? You shouldn't lose your mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, I just made a joke." "Itis also clarified the responsibility of myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jokes? Yes, sometimes the world changes because of jokes. I believe." Newton lowered his voice, and the lenses of his glasses reflected the magic of lighting. Dim light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the four of us, who else knows that Princess Olia is missing in the fortress? Pike; Tap in Lenny. Olia His Royal Highness is in the hands of the enemy. Janika may have guessed it, but she must work with us to save herself. We can do it. We can get more time from the emperor and his eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words made Xiu Lan, Rasta and Itis a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is to be debunked, it will be in the Yongshuang Plain, no, worse than that, staying dead in the wilderness..." Chief Guard The Cavaliers took a sigh of relief. "It’s too dangerous. I said that the eyes of the emperor may be nearby!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being in those places for five years or Is there a big difference when you die? You can't gamble on this, what can you do?" Newton rummaged. This sentence is very convincing, no one refutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there is still a problem... Without the copying of Olia, how can we let Yanika project her shape?" Viscount Rasta Another question was raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am writing a book called "Optics." Copying has always been regarded as a high-level secret magic by the Holy See, but I can already use mirroring and refraction. Surgery plus record elements re-constructed this magic. Soon I will pass it on to Miss Weilun as a reward for this request." Newton quietly said, "I will never admit defeat. Jeter; Newton The reputation will be cleaned by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression is like a pool of stagnant water. I don't know why, this expression makes a few people who have been through the battlefield chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your mood is a bit unstable, go back and calm down. It is not the act to act." Rasta waved his hand. After Newton hurried away, he turned to the remaining two. "...I hope Sid really has more important things to do. Xiu Lan, go find Yanika."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Guardian Knight also sighs Nodded. "Okay. If he doesn't even know what Jeter is going to do, it's even better... Although it's not very likely. This time we are all passengers on board, I hope this ship won't sink." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going into the city with you." Itis took a step forward. "My actions with Xiu Lan can prevent others from doubting. After all, I The boss is also a very smart person, we can't be seen by him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, I will not write this in the report submitted to the headquarters. You should pay more attention to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights shrugged: " As you go, everyone has to submit a report anyway. I have to go back to stabilize the military and go first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing each other’s opinion, "Fog Eagle" has to Go to perform your own tasks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis and Xiu Lan rushed to the city to see the residents living in the heavily guarded Marshal House. The guard of the mansion was very familiar with Itis, and he quickly released the two. Of course, these people cannot know the true identity of "Raditz; Govar" and "Fog Eagle", which are absolute secrets of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Major General Eugen is talking about the situation with the Marshal today, and has not left yet." The captain reminded them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, if you find a servant to inform, you can tell the deputy commander of the Teman of the Coman Volunteers." Isis commanded. After the officer of the sergeant left, she smiled and said to Xiu Lan, "I think we can slow down and give Eugen a little more time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, when they walked to the office of Gowar, they happened to come across the new one. He and Itis chilled a few words, and after saying hello to the Cavaliers, they quickly left. The two opened the door and walked into the office, seeing that the marshal was burying his head in his arms and closing his eyes. After Itis opened another layer of anti-detection enchantment, she greeted her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sonyka, yes. Now it's all about yourself, relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ninica, who turned into a Govar appearance, came over and lie on the sofa on his side, holding his right hand on his cheek and rubbing his head to complain to both. "This day is finally over... so tired. General Eugen has just talked about a lot of strategic analysis, and reminded me to pay attention to the two potential enemy forces in the north and south of the city. He seems to have anticipated your failed raid, a little I didn’t express any surprise at this.” She directly said what Eugen’s intentions were. “In addition, he transferred a lot of troops to the southwest to stop the team asking for help. We also controlled their transmission coordinates, and should still be able to Get a day or two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, I came here today to talk to you about the raid, Miss Weilun." Xiu Lanshen Taking a breath and sinking, "It may be a bit sudden... but Uncle Jete died in that battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big... Uncle? Uncle Jeter? He... is it dead?” Yanika slammed up and felt dizzy. Suddenly knowing that someone who knew someone died made her feel a little uncomfortable. "Is he not a senior priest? Why is it dead? He should have the power of resurrection magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there are some places where he has difficulty playing, such as Say anti-magic zone. You should also know that the Free Army is equipped with a lot of anti-magic generators." Xiu Lan explained with anger, "may be the opponent's powerful caster, or set a wonderful trap. Southerners It’s enough, even the Pope has a way to kill.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 faintly felt a sense of guilt. She knows at least two officers of the Free Army... Is it that Soledon and Annie killed Uncle? But she then ruled out this possibility. Uncle Jett’s intrepid is what she saw with her own eyes. She does not believe that she will have this ability with her childhood friend Soledon or Anne who is full of sorrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a bigger problem, that is, the hall of Olia falls into the hands of the enemy. We can't let the security minister know this thing, absolutely not. Isaac also hopes that he can avenge his uncle on the front line. So, we have a ruthless request..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you want me to Playing the roles of Olivia and Govar?" When I heard the statement that Itis was turning around, I noticed her purpose directly. Her heart pounded...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a princess? This is what every girl has dreamed of. But can she do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan and Itis nodded at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These two identities probably won’t have the opportunity to use them at the same time. Let’s continue to cover up with your current methods.” Xiu Lan added, “Don’t worry about copying. The problem of magic and information, Isaac said he would solve it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a big problem. We only need her when Sid arrives or other occasions that require Princess Olia to attend. If this happens, Itis will pick you up. As for identity... from now It’s good to use your soldier’s identity. This kind of props is ready for you, foggy eagle?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis nodded, from the portable Inside the shrink bag, a set of blue uniforms from the Northern Army was taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This military uniform is an expensive special magic item that automatically adjusts its body shape, adapts to seasonal changes, and automatically lights up the emperor's gray, black and free army. Switching in the four-color military uniform. I only have this one, it should be more useful for you than staying with me. It is not too difficult to transform it and add new capabilities to it with your ability."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 spit out her tongue and took the dress--when her hand touched the dress, it turned out to be suitable for her. Size! This costume seems to be able to read the essence of the phantom below. She suppressed the urge to break it down and put it on the table. "The Royal Security Department has also developed such a thing? It is really deliberate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The issue of military status does not have to worry, I and Xiu Lan will be responsible for solving it. Tomorrow will be sent together in the logistic documents of tomorrow. We will not stay for too long, or else the intelligence personnel of Eugen will doubt." Itis stood up and lifted the anti-detection magic, and Shulan Left the room together. After they left, Renee picked up the female blue uniform and compared it with the marshal suit on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess... This dress will probably be useful? Anyway, you can't let other people see this set of women's size clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used the simplest morphing magic to turn it into a patch inside her shirt. After that, she arranged the illusion of Gowar's sleep as usual, washed the smell of gunpowder in the bathroom that was used by the maids, and fell asleep in the narrow maid's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja that night; Wei Lun had a dream. In that dream, she lived in a beautiful white luxury palace, enjoying the highest level of cuisine, the most beautiful costumes, talking and dining with a variety of elegant men and women. These men and women are very beautiful, handsome and unclear; they are also very respectful of her, just like respecting a princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the beginning to the end, she has always been alone. It is not her world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is still very long, but the free army is far less relaxed than before. "What should I do next?" is always a big problem. Although he repelled the other party's attempt, no one can guarantee that the enemy will not make more attempts. The doorman added the night patrol force to the three companies, and he went to see the prince who was waking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location was selected in a small barracks. Anne only ordered a dim candle, and the whole room looked very depressed. She dare not let more people know the news, no one knows what those people are thinking about. The hair of the "female priest" in front of him was scattered, his eyes were sloppy, his lips were very tight, and he looked like a wax figure under the candlelight. Annie coughed twice and spoke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We call you Miss Namlock, or call you a break; what about Coleman? Ms."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this, the expression of the brunette has changed in a flash. She looked up and quickly glanced at Anne with a sharp gaze, as if she wanted to say something, but closed her mouth again. Then, she used her elegant speed and her legs, and her hands pressed hard on the table, no longer the look of dejection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, the latter is good. Can you give me a glass of water? It must be made with magic. The source of this cup is unknown, and I am entering the house. Just put it here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was heavily breathed, stood up and took the cup, ready to make water magic. "God... your judgment is right, Anne. She is really a princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what is your full name, Your Highness?" Annie took the cup of water that the princess did not want to drink, and moistened the scorpion. Olia glanced at her rank and shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think that only the nobles need to call the full name of the women of Keman. You just need to call the surname, so it is convenient."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
