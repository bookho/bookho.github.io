The concept that all things in the world are born out of an abstract, all-round omnipotence is undoubtedly a highly acceptable concept. It not only explains the suffering of the world, but also points out the direction of the world. All of the exclusive monotheistic religions we know today are affected by the peace of mind in one form or another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next two decades, those who were once enemies of each other were united under the flag of the Yellow-Taiwan taiji fish in Taiping. This emerging force will conquer half of the world with its army and completely change the other half with their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"New History of the Ancient World of DeLand", Dean University's Ancient History Compilation Committee, Volume IV, Chapter 7 "The Birth and Rise of Taiping Road" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend, Professor Boyer is an ectopic cultural scientist who has invested nearly 20 years since the fall of the Great Wall. The study of the plane culture. In a cocktail party in Xinjing, he talked with some scholars with status about his own research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In some planes, people believe that a mother is a virgin, and that a person without a biological father is a god. He died three days after he died. Forty days later, this man without a father came to the top of the mountain and ascended into the sky. Those outsiders believed that this was God's greatest miracle. His ability was to hear the thoughts of everyone in the world and to see everyone. Doing good or bad things and giving them rewards or punishments is still very effective after they die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the guests, a very famous The Taoist scholar at the Beijing University of the Far East heard an example of this alien religion commenting: “The reason why Wenhua is so interesting and so difficult is this. You have to explain why there are intelligent creatures who believe in such absurdity. The gibberish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Professor Boyer answered, the Taoist has changed to the next topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming the Taoist is a legitimate Taiping believer, he will believe the following series of statements:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right way created the universe, but until an Eastern uprising peasant leader preached it, it had no real power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To borrow the power of the right way, believers need to wear yellow textiles on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right way cannot be expressed in words, but it can express its opinions through the warlords of the commanding army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right way wants the world to become an ideal world, but such a world is illiterate, but lives the life of primitive people and wears animal skins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a cultural scholar from another plane first came into contact with this belief system in Xinjing, I was curious as to what kind of evaluation he would make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-"The illusion of Taiping - why theism is unnecessary", Professor of the University of the Congo, R. Dawkins<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow towel Taiping Daoguo, Fuxixing Province, Guozhou Prefecture (formerly Jiawen Fegner Concession)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Anti-Dian’s forces at the end of Major’s vision of Major Neremon Soledon became a battle that could not be seen at the end. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he picked up the telescope, the military array appeared even more boundless, like the earth cutting open the camp - or the camp cut and open the earth. More than 25,000 yellow scarves are on the scene, just like ants crawling in the distance of the telescope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see the other’s commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge Chinese flag is yellow, with two huge white characters written in oriental characters, and a huge taiji fish logo. The finger resistance was slightly moved, and the reading of these two words was found from the magic net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tai Ping? Was the original two Eastern characters, the Taiping Road's Taiping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as I read these two words, he felt a spiritual tremor. That is the name of the only right way that once conquered half of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the meaning of the Coyman language--" Namimen slowly read out those explanations, "The peace of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peace and tranquility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of this banner, the soldiers of the Taiping Road crossed the barriers of the mountains and the sea and conquered the Murrayman area, where the fertile population of the land was large. And in the sea and the land of this region, a huge country that follows the right path has been established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now those Taoist soldiers in the array. Their battle is not surprising. Like all wars, they divided the troops into several different military arrays, and the Chinese flag was hidden behind the striker array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two military's rides and the free mage's fire interaction test, the test fire of the artillery guns of both sides occasionally roared. Most of the shells landed in the middle of the open space between the two armies. Occasionally, several shells of the Yellow Scarf Army crossed the gap of three miles and landed in front of the Freedom Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This calibration test method is according to our code." A famous staff member whispered around him. "Fortunately, there seems to be a lack of new magic guns. Gunpowder should not be "Bundled with medicine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They didn't have a bomb, it didn't really bode well. If there were artillery, there would be bombing. Occurs." Another staff member who had served on the New Zhou front added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there was a staff member who couldn’t help but curious and put the famous rumor on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that Marshal Lopez has personally trained the guardian army of the Green Bull House. Is this true? You must know his disciple? How many free army-level troops are there in the opposite direction?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a bitter smile, I don’t know how to answer this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he does know Clade Lopez, the Marshal’s adventure in the East is no more known than the colleagues of these Freedom Forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenny’s tabloids have indeed been a great adventure for many new marshals – if you believe in all these stories, Marshal Lopez should be annihilated in the East. With more than 10 million people in the army, the two emperors, the seven-year-old king, and the scorpion will win countless numbers, slaughter three dozen dragons and Yalong, learn more than 30 kinds of curses, and accumulate 500 More than one kind of rare materials and magical items, three princesses, six nephews and seventy-two lovers were also smashed. All these peerless women shed tears when they returned to the West, bringing together three rivers, seven lakes and ten Several magic items called "The Tears of Someone". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t look for the Marshal to confirm these problems, but from the time when Janica just left home instead of cutting her head, at least this last one It should be a rumor... probably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Marshal should have trained some of the troops in the opposite side of the Yellow Turban..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naimen coughed a little, screaming, sneaking his hand into his coat pocket and holding the water blue soul gem stitched inside the coat. The magic on this gem is too eye-catching, and he dare not carry it publicly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his brain, he hurriedly meditated on the matter he wanted to inquire, hoping to find some information from Anne's memory of memories of later generations. According to his experience, the memory library is used to predict the historical summary of the future, but it is only a bit of a big and unreasonable historical summary, but it is better to use the knowledge of the Free Army's staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really too lazy to remind you that I am not Anne, such a fascinating entry, let me turn it over. Lopez's entry six, Luo Ruide's experience in the East, This entry may contain controversial content... Since the historical data of the Eastern Empire was scattered before and after the War of Disruption, the historians now study the subject mainly from Murrayman, West Tang and the Far East. Old files, as well as some notes and anthologies..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss memory lady uses the voice of Anne Seifer without feelings and no sense of urgency I really don't know when I can find the topic. The podium was cold for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, another person answered the key part of the question for Nanimen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the 20,000 new Guards are trained by Marshal Luo, those troops are basically transferred to Donghua for jihad. Now 30,000 yak The pro-military division of the Fushun Division was trained by the recruits of the new army. Half of them were in the Qingniu Prefecture, and the other half were scattered in various provinces. They were led by Zhang Futu’s cronies and monitored the key personnel.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenmen is answering this question by Zhang Shiyi, Miss Zhang. Today’s Hengqu Zhang’s female channel is still a custom-made Intre red cloak, which makes her almost invisible in the surrounding Freedom Army officers – even more pure than the uniforms of many officers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, how much do you think this enemy can belong to this..." The questioning operational staff stuttered and repeated The name of the enemy, "What is this army of the priests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up to three thousand. Also includes artillery trained in accordance with our Free Army regulations." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zhang Da smashed the ponytail, replied cheerfully and categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, these re-transmissions, three-disciple disciples, can't be the opponents of our pro-disciplinary governor!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi’s ministry immediately laughed at the venue and led the staff of the Freedom Army to laugh. This sentence made me listen to the magic net Anne slowly swallowed the door to the danger, did not come out, he had to smile and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand people... So, is the enemy of the enemy probably this unit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; An intelligence officer pointed his finger at the enemy with a hand holding a monocular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left wing of the Yellow Turban Army is moving forward, consisting of about four or five small military arrays, all using typical long-line queues, slightly winged Before the trend, the Chinese army was slightly delayed. In the middle of this army, it is a slightly smaller military flag. About four or five people are as tall as they are, with a few Oriental characters on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...After the merger of the Republic of Murray in the Far East Republic, in order to prove the legality of the merger, the archaeological excavations related to Luo Ruide’s protection The focus of the work of the new Beijing historical scholars, they found the old Pacific kingdom fortress located in the suburbs of Shengzhou..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the door, it sounds, Anne memory These things in mindfulness are no different from the book of heaven. It is not so much the Coman standard language, it is better to say that there are several Coyman prepositions and conjunctions between some Eastern words, and almost all the proper nouns mentioned in it are unheard of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Annie, I understand. Now let me explain the meaning of the big characters."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey. You never listen to me." The synthetic sound of the memory - described by another special noun that has never been heard by the door is electronic sound - still no fluctuations And feelings, "The few words are 'School of the State of the thorns', meaning 'the historian Tao Daren who monitors rebellion in the land of revenge.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The chief of this army is a historian?" Resist the door. "The traditions of the Eastern countries are really strange. However, since it is an official who supervises rebellion, it is probably the elite defender of the resurrection." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, why did the enemy only send such troops to attack us?" asked a young lieutenant who had just joined the army in Interlake. "Even if the other army is trained by the Marshal, they should not expect 3,000." Can people beat us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slightly lack of military common sense has silenced everyone. The staff did not answer this question, not because they did not know the answer, but because answering this question may damage their morale and everyone would not bear this responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See no one interface, Nami Soleton had to turn around and answer this question with a cautious tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They feel that we have less troops. Our troops can't even maintain a long line as long as the other side. Sending a large army is just a waste of the soldier's physical strength and the caster. The other side feels that with their strength advantage, they can boldly send avant-garde and fight for us; if the breakthrough is natural, even if there is no breakthrough, we can send a birth force to take turns to drag us down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed here for a while, and was preparing to move out of his experience in the Western Army to boost morale, Zhang Shiyi inserted in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In other words, that means they took the initiative to send the most powerful forces of the entire army to us, giving us the opportunity to break them in one fell swoop. As long as we can defeat them in one fell swoop, the remaining 20,000 people are not enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the end of the door is still a little confusing, but these words are also what he wants to say of. He raised his head and pointed his finger at the four-color cross flag on the high point of the podium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly the case. The emperor emperor took the 200,000 army south, and he also wanted to exhaust our living power, but he failed to do it. The enemy opposite us Only three thousand soldiers, but also want to exhaust us, it is ridiculous! Let the artillery begin to intercept the shooting on the maximum range! You, ready to let the independent military police and cavalry attack orders, as long as the enemy began to defeat, they will chase after victory, one fell through The enemy's main battle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his heart is still uneasy. If the opposing army is really advancing and recovering, it will become a war of attrition. How will this matter end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that the preparations I have done before will work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not endure Live and hold Anne's memory gem, whispering in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the striker of Fuxi Yellow Turban, Tianshi pro-hands and handsome, and the state of the thorns Tao Taoji is also watching the enemy array with his cronies. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backed by the important town of Guozhou, the attacking Red Army has a formation that is not long and has a strong concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the center, there are two red-armed phalanxes with neat arrays and a sense of oppression, each with a different banner and a coat of arms pattern. The wings are slightly retreating, ensuring that the incoming enemies cannot be smuggled or flanked as the main target. These are the seemingly messy cross-barrel rebels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most threatening is the artillery camp and the Chinese army deployed behind. Although the troops are few, the artillery battalion of the Red Army has built a simple artillery base based on the buildings outside the state. Under the banner of the Chinese army, there were gathered a thousand cavalry and a lineup of elite infantry, and some teams dressed in green were caught in it, presumably the family of Yimen. In front of these reserve teams, at the intersection of the two Red Army squads, there is also a huge golden man, as if the legendary emperor cast the siege weapons, which puts tremendous pressure on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are about three battalions on the front and left wings, and the slashers on the sides are the thieves of the cross-river. It is not enough."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the three battalions are dissatisfied, the enemy’s left and right wings add up to fear that there are also two thousand birds, which are very threatening, adults. Our strength will be Not a small injury. Or will it still be a trial attack, and will not fall back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A stern, iron-like color Tao Daoji shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first attack of this time must be broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, the thorny adult..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the right way to judge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao’s history Seriously speaking this sentence, no one will refute it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the Zhu Jue from the New Guardian Army, Tao Daoji is a Taoist, which makes his orders almost no one dare to defy. Converted to Coman's Masters Judging System, he should be able to securely receive a golden badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spellcaster of the Taiping Road is divided into two parts: the monk and the Taoist. Just like their taiji fish logo, one is yin and the other is yang. The former was born, similar to the Western magicians, most of them are unwilling to serve the secular regime. Only a few people are willing to take advantage of the military to gain utilitarianism; the latter is the pillar of the religious regime of the Taiping Taoist countries, and most of them are in high positions in the Taoist countries. The monks absorbed the unruly casters of the Murrayman countries, and the Taoist scholars supported the spiritual dimension of this great regime, guaranteeing the nominal dominance of the Green Bulls to the various military states. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao Daoji is the latter. He is a thoroughly Murreman native. His real name is Nasreddin. After he has been a Taoist for more than ten years, he took the name of "Dowji" according to the custom. After Zhang Futu seized the Qingniufu, he was one of the first Taoist scholars to lose to the new teacher. He finally got the equivalent of the Archbishop of the South Road of Fuxi Province, and was awarded several years later. Reporting the history of the state, responsible for monitoring the changes in the four states of the southwestern road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the first time he feels he has to perform this duty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You also saw the letter of the squad of the thief army last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Tao Daoji asked again. Two or three people in his guards would be confused, but most of them stunned and removed their gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the reason we must win. Except for our Tianshi pro-military, the rest of the troops we don't know who can trust, even Zhu Zhizhi It’s also shaken. If our first attack fails, it’s possible that someone will change to the other side. No matter how much it costs, win! Let all the monks prepare as planned!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taishhi's deceased face will put tremendous pressure on the surrounding people. In order to reflect the importance of this offensive, he repeated the order again: "God to advance, must break through the enemy in this attack, and live in the emirate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As their troops advanced, the shells began to fall loosely among the formations of the Heavenly Masters. The weapons of the United Army artillery were removed from the seagoing vessels, mostly heavy artillery that was not easy to move, but the power was indeed sufficient. The shells are not always accurate, but every time they bombard the shells of the enemy, they will cultivate a bloody ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Tianshi’s pro-independence is the first soldier in the country. This scattered attack cannot make them back, but the speed of progress is slightly slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The formation is strict, you know something about the artillery, not the opponent who can retreat by the artillery. Don't fire, wait for me to order! Fill the spare gun in the back!" <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major General Dubreu Gaohao, who commanded the 14th Navy’s Task Force on the left, made such a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pre-war conference discussed that this unit is based on close combat with the support of the caster. All troops are ready for melee!" 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 。 <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one question: Where will the enemy point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three thousand days of the division’s army stopped a little outside the firing range. Under the continuous bombardment of the joint artillery, 3,000 people became 2,900, or 2,800. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try it out, can you lie to them to shoot in a row?" Tao Daoji ordered, "stop outside the hundred steps."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Tianshi pro-military immediately divided a few hundred people and shouted forward to charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the right way!" "For the right way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in the wings of the Zhuhai regiment raised a gun. The third platoon of the team was not even disturbed at all, and it continued to be filled with spare muskets - this time the Freedom Forces had brought enough rifles to equip the half division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wing of the Dragon Guns, there were more than a dozen people who couldn’t help but ignite the fire, but these arbitrarily shot soldiers were immediately commanded to stop their sergeants. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no way to deceive the sneak shots. These hundreds of people dropped more than a dozen bodies that were shelled and killed and retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao Daoji frowned and called all the Taoist priests and conveyed new orders. Soon, these Taoist priests ran to the front of the army and dragged the shallow ditch on the land with a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do they want to do?" The joint military staff who couldn’t figure out what the other party is doing are talking about it. "Is it a magical array?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, those grooves gradually formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s shrinking into the inch!" Zhang Shiyi, who was watching the situation on the podium, screamed out, "This kind of Taoism can be used for such a large scale." Force!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shrinking into the inch?" Hearing this strange name, the door asked, "What kind of magic?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them strengthen their defense now! Order first, endure, I will wait a little longer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;张时翼Shouted impatiently. The staff members glanced at the door, and the major nodded decisively and ordered all units to step up their vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a short-range space magic that can quickly get troops out of danger, usually only for small units-"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet waiting for Zhang Shiyi to finish, the battlefield has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge Yellow Scarf Army has begun to move. Under the guidance of the Taoist priests, the first row of yellow towels crossed the boundaries they had just drawn -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then these yellow scarves appeared in the distance from the "Zhuhai" The task force has only twenty steps! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assault, the righteous warriors, assault!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao Daoji stopped here, screaming Shouted. The singer of the head of the yellow towel screamed, the musketeer quickly shot, then dropped the weapon, pulled out the long sword for the body to rush forward; not many rifles and knives directly rushed to the enemy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round of shooting, instantly let Gao Huo group down dozens of people. Seeing the huge enemy forces that suddenly appeared in front of me, even the veterans could not help but feel a shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the short-range delivery of the inflated, Dongyi version. But a short-distance transmission that can send three thousand soldiers at a time is unheard of! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Master Dubri Gaohao is unwavering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out his pistol and pointed at the enemy army in full swing. A shot crashed into a yellow towel army that rushed over and shouted loudly: "All, three Rows of volleys!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao Daoji's pupils have shrunk instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked to see that all the non-commissioned officers on the opposite side were like being whipped by the leather whip, while standing and hoeing to the right, conveying the general of Reds The command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three rows of volleys!" "Three rows of volleys!" "Three rows of volleys!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When the striker of the Yellow Turban army was ten steps away from the enemy, everyone in the Gaohuo Department heard the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first row of people all collapsed, the heavy firearms on the brackets that had long been inserted in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the black hole, the yellow towel striker's speed is slow, and there are seven steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three more steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third row of people stood straight, the muzzle also lifted up, directly opposite the yellow towel army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first batch of Yellow Turbans, the three most brave warriors had thrown their spears out and several soldiers were overturned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors on both sides can even smell the stench in the enemy's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guns of every soldier in the Gaohuo Department are facing A yellow towel warrior who is rushing over and close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black smoke that covers the sky rises and obscures the sight of both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless screams sounded at the same time, mixed with the explosive explosion of gunpowder, like a sub-theme of a symphony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao Daoji headed back, the right hand sword flashed, and the flying sword slammed two lead shots that hit him directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is a third lead that comes with it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A road volley flies up and wraps the bullet of the heavy musket. The spurs have a slap in the face, the left hand clamps the tail, and the feet step on the foot. After taking eight steps to remove this force, the left hand smashed the road sign and the lead bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round of volley hurts his stomach and starts to hurt. How many loyal yellow scarves are sacrificed? Four hundred? five hundred? Six hundred? At such a close distance, how many people are possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assault! Don't go back! For the right way!" he shouted, "For the right way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The sergeant intercepts the enemy! Change the gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dubri Gaoho pulls out the commanding sword and slams two yellow jerseys into the array. And ordered the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change gun!" "Change gun!" "Change gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pass The name of the person seems to be a lot less. Many people have already invested in the hand-to-hand combat, and many soldiers in the first row and even the second row have been overturned by the Yellow Warriors. But by the cover of black smoke - or because of the black smoke mask, almost no one on both sides retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each member of the Zhuhai regiment has at least two spare guns, At the feet. Some of the soldiers who have already fought have been smashed with the loading rods and body knives and the enemies. The sergeant has also invested in the interception. The second round of shooting has been scattered a lot, but it is still deafening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the side of the Cliff Group finally reacted. Cliff decisively ordered the shooting from the left side of the enemy's nearest row, while the right side of the row strode forward, smashing the large group of enemies close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon Guns, free shooting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the sea groups, free shooting!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This became the last straw to crush the Tianshi. Two rounds of three rows of volleys have gone to the Yellow Turban army of hundreds of soldiers, the most brave pro-military team and commando team in the army is almost swept away. Seeing that the side was attacked by the enemy, the soldiers behind were even less willing to rush into the black smoke to face the muzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes them even more scared is the huge golden man who started to move slowly. The Jin people rushed to the front of Gao Huo and began to cover the obvious general of the Red Army. Four or five monks who were originally going to take his first level were easily torn into two paragraphs by this huge golden man, and people couldn’t help but think of the twelve gold people in the history books who called the "people of the world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stone Master! Let's order the reorganization!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One pro will speak loudly Tao Daoji shouted. The state of the thorns bite the teeth, and the pro-arms turned over the horse, chased the few fastest escaped soldiers, cut their first level one by one, and then took the big flag from the palm-handler, and personally pushed the banner underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-military team screamed for the new order of the history. Thinking of the identity of the chief justice jurist, the retreating soldiers began to reorganize their formations - after all, they still have nearly two thousand people. In the previous round of assaults, the enemy forces on the opposite side were afraid of two or three hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not effective even if you shrink into the inch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao Daoji’s face is not just Iron color, it has become iron blue. Since the re-editing of the Tianshi pro-military, the battle has been invincible, and the attack has been invincible. This is the first time that it has been blocked by a powerful enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round of offense and defense is so intense that both sides feel that they can't bear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s true that Heavenly Masters, no matter whether it is Taoism or training, is not much weaker than the regular army of the Free Army." The handrail exclaimed, "Fortunately, the high-caliber general is even better. If it is to attack Cliff's team, I really don't know if I can hold it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is around The mixed-blooded girl is frowning—especially after seeing the flag of the state’s thorny state stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resistance to the door, now, the cavalry who puts us in the cross channel!" Zhang Shiyi patted the railing of the podium with his hand. "The troops repaired the Taoist More, I don’t want to fight them now, it’s hard to have a second chance!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes. Now give high-ranking Major... No, high Huo Shao’s formation was too strict, and gave Colonel Cliff a command! Let him give up the passage!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Follow, sir!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi turned and prepared to go down to the podium, and the doorman hurriedly pulled her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute, Miss Zhang! This is too dangerous on the battlefield. If you have a problem and lose the support of the Hengqu, we are not stepping into it. Dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi stopped and violently turned and said: "But if I don't go, my cavalry will step into the dead. I am the game. Wing Tak, the highest martial arts person in the army, I am not responsible for the rushing, who can take my place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is looking around, but can not find Replace her people. He has the heart to go by himself, but he knows that he can't be responsible for the position that is going to face the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it and got a sabre from his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you must be in person, then bring this up. This is the best cavalry sabre I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He solved the weapon that looked like the officer’s standard sabre at the waist and handed it to Zhang Shiyi’s hand. The surrounding staff members have widened their eyes and whispered inconspicuously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is... is 'benevolent'?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The emperor's emperor Sword?! Can this be given?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi is also stunned. She took the sword with a slightly trembling hand and couldn't help but pull it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the sheath, it was still an ordinary iron sword; but at the moment when Jianfeng left the scabbard, the light-handed sword suddenly became thinner. The front shines brightly in the morning sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Nanimen said, this sword is the best cavalry sword in the world. When kindness kills a person, the person's body does not even shift. If a knight uses it to kill an enemy, it won't even slow down the horse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"尚方宝剑......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zhang Da speaks to herself in her own language . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does this word mean?" Ningmen couldn't understand the word and asked a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi smiled and changed his mouth and asked: "For the door, if I don't return your sword, is it okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang Shiyi looks shocked. She stared at the sword for a moment, shook her head and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a joke, don’t take it seriously. This is the spoils of your life. I swear, I will bring you this sword completely. Thank you, Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The emperor left the sword and returned to the north. People are more important than swords. Please be sure to bring yourself back." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with honey-colored hair smiled and muttered to the ancestors Mantra. As the Eastern monosyllabic words swayed at her tongue, her hair gradually darkened, as if the ancient warrior's soul was attached to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joint Army Cavalry, let me attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, she did not use it again The term "cross-channel cavalry". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Zhang Shiyi put on an enchanted helmet made of translucent crystal, put down the anti-arrow mask, jumped down from the podium, and even ran Jumped a few steps and jumped on his own horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and the eight hundred cavalry rushed to the right wing like a tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, Colonel Cliff received an order from the command tower. He hesitated a little and gave a slightly different order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the Dragon Guns, spread out to the two wings, assault on the row, let the central passage pass to the cavalry!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Current Colonel" also wears his own arm. Since losing three fingers, he has been unable to use ordinary muskets or weapons, and has specially customized this weapon for hand-to-hand combat. Before volunteering to join the National Guard, Cliff was a well-known duel coach who taught other techniques of swords, firearms, and magic duels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cliff has just installed his weapon, and the cavalry whizzes past him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pioneer of the cavalry is the Zhang Shiyi of the red shirt. Her right hand dragged the handle "kindness", which leaps flexibly on the left and right sides of her horse, occasionally pointing upwards, killing enemy cavalry and monks. The western seats of the entire cross-channel, that is, the high-ranking Confucianists, followed her, resisting and dispelling the Taoist tactics of the enemy monks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of her horseshoe is the newspaper stalker who is gathering the soldiers to prepare for the second attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao Daozi’s face is also distorted. The enemy cavalry came so fast and so fierce that it was beyond his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This woman is the current commander of Zhang's in the Hengqu, and the eldest daughter of Zhang Changbao, who is in the sea of ​​Yangfeng County, Haifeng County?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the letter of persuasion sent by the rebels, it was so falling, nicknamed Zhang Shiyi." One will answer the words, "She has a sharp sword." It seems that it is the emperor's emperor's sword, which should have been owned by Luo Taijun's disciple. It may have been given to her before the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tiger girl, the name is not ruined..." Tao Daoji's face was a smattering, and the first time he sacrificed the flying sword. "If you can slap it under the horse, you can win this battle! Let me rush!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taoist scholar jumped off Malay, and the Yuanling came out of the shell, gathering the whole body's spirits on the flying sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying sword jumped into the air, and Tao Daoji observed the position of Zhang Shiyi through its height, looking for the opportunity to hit a shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around have changed their faces. This is the first time they have seen Tao Daoji offering a flying sword with Yuan Ling. More than one person thinks this way: no wonder he can win the trust of the Master, and he is in charge of the overall situation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protect the torso of the thorny adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining monks immediately formed around The defensive array, the reorganized troops are also assembled in front, and the dozens of heavy shields are blocked in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang Shiyi's hair is more than all black - after the blood, the ponytail has become a mixture of blush and black, the original light yellow transparent crystal mask has also been dyed red crystal. She is burying her head in the battle with dozens of Yellow Warriors who have just assembled. It is not so much a battle but a massacre. She only needs to move forward. The yellow towel army and trainee monks are not flying their heads to the sky, or when the chest is cut out of the "kindness" by a long and neat wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao Daoji calmed down and held the breath that did not exist, waiting for her to rush out of the formation and turn around and turn back to the horse. With the gathering of Yuanling, Feijian gradually turned red, purple, and black, waiting in the air, waiting. Finally, Zhang Shiyi broke through the enemies and bowed his head. The left hand grabbed the reins and pulled back. The horse head pointed directly at the position where Tao Daoji was physically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jurist concentrates on the power of the whole body, and the flying sword is broken. The air makes a harsh sound of humming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this voice, Zhang Shiyi as the target is not heard. Because the speed of flying with the Yuanling Feijian will spread faster than the sound of the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the indescribable moment of the language, Zhang Shiyi did not return to raise his right arm, and the tip of the sword happened to point to the flying sword flying straight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She actually observed the actions of Tao Daoji, already waiting here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no panic in the history of the Tao, and it didn’t even change the flight route. The speed of the flying sword has been mentioned so fast, and he is not allowed to change the flight at all. route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Zhang Shiyi’s finger is already in his calculations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taoist does not know how powerful the so-called "kindness" is, and whether he can cut off his flying sword. But whether the sword was broken or his flying sword was opened, Tao Daoji was not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the monk before the cultivation of the Yuanling, perhaps the flying sword will be broken and the body will be injured, and then unable to control the flying sword. But the high-ranking monks who have cultivated Yuanling are different. Even if the flying sword is blocked in two sections, he can still control the remaining half to kill the opponent; even if the flying sword is cut open from it, he can control the rest. Half of the flying sword flew along the ridge of the sword and stabbed into the other's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how smart the martial arts of Zhang Shiyi is, how powerful is the family’s method of falling spirits, in the face of a true high-level Taiping monk, these three abuses The tricks are also not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tao Daoji is attached to the flying sword and goes straight to the tip of the sword without slowing down. He has already figured out which half to kill the woman in front of him. . He had a little bit of pity and cherished the idea of ​​jade. He thought that if this small channel handsome after the war still had a whole body, he could bring it back to find a sectarian sect of the corpse, and don't waste this natural beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment he touched the tip of the sword, he knew that he had underestimated the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think it’s the sword of Titian’s emperor? I have been practicing for many years, and I’ve been looking for more than 80 kinds of heavenly treasures. The chopper was usually cut open--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Zhang Shiyi looked up and had cold and disdain in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last thought of the history of the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment of Feijian’s contact with “benevolentness”, Zhang Shiyi’s first right wrist is turned, then the small arm is shaken—<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using this sword to pick out a sword in the air that doesn't know how many times it shakes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every dither of this sword flower just happened to be smashed from the flying sword, and the flying sword that accumulates Tao Daoji’s life spirit is counted Hundreds of small pieces! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long is the Tao Tao Ji Xiu as a superhuman, he also has no ability to attach to a handle that has been smashed into hundreds of pieces, the magic circuit and the Dafa rune are smashed Above the flying sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of the newspaper’s history was suddenly confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi had already had a good horsepower. She shook her reins and kicked her left foot Spurs, rushing to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, everyone has become a mess, surrounded by seven bloody, stunned adults who don’t know what to do, the defensive formation has been loopholes So big that she can let her entire cavalry team pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Zhang Shiyi rushing to the horse, the Tianshi pro-arms in front of him screamed and fled, leaving only the last few confidants around the newspaper No soul torso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi was a horse, and the handle of the hand was "kind", and several big heads flew at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow Scarf Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Tao Daoji’s head flying in the air, Zhu’s hand in the middle of the Yellow Turban’s main squad trembled, and the telescope fell to the ground. The surrounding staff and the masters were silent, and no one dared to speak first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Zhang Futu is not actually surnamed Zhang, this is a Taoist of the Fudong. He is very lucky, and he met a capable Red Army mercenary commander. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, or the state of the state, he broke the silence and said something that has nothing to do with the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is now a real surnamed Zhang who meets the land of this great mercenary commander, and he also carries a real Red Army." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the teacher tried to follow the sentence, hoping to test the true meaning of the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The war has not failed yet. I can also beat them at the risk of being wiped out by the whole army, and then get an empty city of Gou, then wait for the beach." Retaliation. Or..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhu Taishou paused and remembered the letter. The letter that was sent to the hands of each of the generals in his army through the magic net and the spies. After Tao Daoji took away almost all the people who were loyal to the Green Bull House, the rest of the people were not very loyal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can also choose to fight for the future division, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone knows the choice of their sergeant here. Someone immediately offered a plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the ancient Zhao State, there was such a story that the general who made the mistakes carried the wattle and asked his chief to sin..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Zhu Zhizhi and his men discussed countermeasures, the riding red dress went straight through the battlefield. The sword in her hand is invisible, but no one can stop her even one step. The cavalry behind Zhang Shiyi was divided into three roads. The most ones followed him to the Chinese army, which was straight to Zhu. The remaining two roads were chasing the broken Tianshi pro-arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five hundred rides crossed the entire battlefield. No one fires and no artillery roars, just like no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The former army is separated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the banner of this command, the huge The Yellow Turban Army array separated in front of Zhang Shiyi and gave way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi was in front of Lema, defending the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sinister thief is dead! Make a choice now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave Weapons! Throw the weapons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small horse team galloped from the direction of the Chinese army camp and shouted orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the Guozhou Taishou Zhu decided to roll down Malay in front of her, the Chinese costume was covered with dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big man who is old enough to be Zhang’s father and father, squatting, humbly screaming, first touch the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
