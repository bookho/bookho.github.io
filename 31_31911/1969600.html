			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subvolume notice<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest mobilization in the history of the North, the biggest crisis in the history of the South. Due to the factual rebellion in the Republic of Turk and the Northern Military Region, the free country did not have enough troops available for a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to fight civil war, but if you want to attack, I can only accompany you. Do you know who the real enemy is? It is an empire!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The empire must be given to Steelburg! The ownership of the Central Plains of Koman is related to the success or failure of the empire! All the Principality and the waiting country, fully mobilized!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men and women act separately, from the special envoys of the Republic of Turk, the former enemies will turn into combat friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which of the special unions do you think are the best? You, me, or someone else? Let us decide with the winners and losers--Get Ruuck’s People are the winners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the people of the Ruhrocks can determine the ownership of the Republic of Conroy. I have only worked hard for this life and will continue to work hard. Go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance; Sorryton raised his head and looked up at the misty sun. When young girls look up to reality, they will understand that there is a heavy thing called responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then I slowly discovered that I don’t have any dreams that must be realized. My thinking is always influenced by the people around me, I always It is for them to work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe... I have found what I want to work for."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spy, intelligence, diplomacy, the lives and wealth of millions of people are hanging on the front line, and a full-scale war may break out at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the beginning, the layout was first, and then the parties began to settle down. By the time the war began, everything was already doomed. The war never believed in genius, and the plan always Decide on success or failure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The genius of war, you will not know if you do not participate in the war. All plans will be destroyed when they are executed. - But we still have to make it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winding line of destiny, the warm spring of early spring, the faint spring smog, the butterflies in the storm enter the cloud New chapter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing, maybe it should be called ideal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ideal is just a mirage. Determining the means, and the means always in turn affects the purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dran to Lenny, from Steelburg to Kengler, in Fort Vatti The offensive and defensive warfare, peace trembled on the wire, the elites of both sides of the South and North, the story of bis finally launched! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light volume - "thin brume". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;postscript of this volume<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pure chat<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, first make a few thoughts and gossip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! The road to literature is really a kind of business that requires talent! (Aria)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really hard to do things like me who have no talent to do whatever they want. The most painful thing is not genius, nor mediocrity that is complacent at the current level, but the two knives that do not struggle with perseverance and do nothing. Anyway, if you write a postscript now, it is not empty talk, you can finally write some serious thoughts and writing intentions. Reiterate in advance: My profile is absolutely not deceiving readers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-rolling volume was finally finished, and the first part of "Butterfly" was also declared over. It took about four months to write a full 49 sessions, "Complete Words 358450" (very serious addition: in fact, the statistics of the starting point are not accurate, pure text is only 640k, how can there be 350,000 words?). So many words, and the fast hand is still far away, but the speed is barely boastful, at least the things that come out are not too bad (of course, not so good). I still feel a lot easier when I fill in the last line of the volume. Looking back at the words written in the past four months, I feel that the charging and brewing in the past two years has not been in vain, and that there are some improvements. Although it is not a lot, I will feel shame when I look back and stand again. The ambition of "must be completely revised in the future" (why should I say again...). In the future, if I have the opportunity to write a complete book, I will probably put gbr in the position of bis. At present, according to the outline, gbr is a "prologue". Remnant light, trade style and heavy ambition are "one chapter". Then the author is worried about writing two chapters first or three chapters first...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I write books not for the attention of the people, but for the classics to be passed on to the future." - Ancient Greece, Thucydides<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really want to write It's "Butterfly in the Storm", gbr;n is just a preface to the butterfly." - Imitate Ossen; Koster; Card's arrogant words<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Well, let's get back to the topic. As you can see now, this yy is full of spoofs that are not so concealed. The works that appear to be messy are actually written as super-long epic fantasy. Under the atmosphere of spoofing and light comedy, it is a complete set of epic fantasy levels and worldviews. The chronology, geography, and humanity of the story, the author is confident that it will not be much worse than any epic fantasy setting in the world. Only with the setting of the world view, I have the money to be proud of myself (in other words, as a novelist, it is a failure...). As for the ultimate goal of a person’s lofty vision, it is a set of true epic works that “can stand up and be seen by others even on the bookshelf at home” (in fact, as long as they are placed on the author’s own bookshelf, the author does not blush. It’s... really). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the chaotic combination of technology and magic, follow a very simple and striking world rule: and this criterion is exactly the opposite of the fantasy formula that starts with lotr. of. Since Tolkien’s decline, most of the epic fantasy works have a very obvious feature: in the world view, there is a “good era that has passed away” or “the lost ancient advanced civilization” – in a word It means that "the past is better than modern." The Lord of the Rings itself is a beautiful world that is fictionalized to fill the ancient myths, not to mention; Ista of the Dragon Gun, the real city of Amber, the colorless empire of Feilun, and the ancient civilizations of countless games and novels. "Ancient language magic", "Lost Atlantis"... All of this can be said to be the image of the Christian Eden, or the longing for the good times of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my world is set differently: in this worldview, there is an ancient empire that perishes, but there is absolutely no "strong civilization." The basis of bis's worldview is "rationality." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, "rational." Bis's worldview recognizes the butterfly effect, does not recognize the existence of fate; recognizes the laws of history and does not recognize historical necessity. Bis's worldview allows magic to exist, allowing religion to exist, but it does not recognize creationism and recognizes natural selection. The world of bis has a god, but it is not God-made, but artificial. Everything is set to follow rationality. Here, the curse is not an ancient curse, but is gradually developed with the development of the times; spiritual power is not the enemy of science, but the two wings of scientific methods. The magic technology of the old times is always not as strong as the new era. This is a magical world that is constantly improving. It does not stay in a fixed era forever, but keeps moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the setting of a very idealistic philosophy: In this world, the spirit determines the power. The power of magic is determined only by the strength of the belief. The sword does not suppress the pen, and power and violence cannot suppress wisdom and thought. Because there is magic as the blade of the wise, because there is magic as a gun of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest and purest yy, laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary and review<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the first volume is not enough bricks...this time second The volume is always enough. As far as my personal writing is concerned, the advantages and disadvantages of bis are very significant, which is very suitable for the snake. (Insert advertising: Now you can push the author to improve in the following chapters! There are not many good chances of biting, now bite, quick effect, bite, and return, want to bite as fast!) Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the self-review of the plot. Compared with the big reversal of the first volume, the reversal of the second volume, according to some readers, "but when the author reveals the answer, I suddenly find that there is no change, it is inevitable that I am disappointed." This... and the last few sections of the work may still have something to do with it. Although, I have tried my best to be "unexpected and reasonable"... So far, I can only count as "the first-class half of the plot", I will work harder to improve the outline. (Ah, hahahaha... the story behind... let you keep the impression of "no change" now, ah hahahaha...)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then It’s a writing...writing...I’m probably like this, and then it’s gorgeous, it’s going to be an eunuch. You see, the most gorgeous people in writing, like to dig pits as eunuchs - because gorgeous writing is unlikely to remain in the epic level. I am very aware of the fact that I have no talent, so I have no expectations for writing. To really rely on the refining of words, the writing can indeed raise another level... However, how can it be possible to refine the word in the super-long article, then it can be written to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
