			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the grace of the Gods be with us forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lieutenant Leiden yawned and looked at the people on the stage and felt a little funny. To be honest, he never thought that the pastor responsible for the Lord's prayer would be this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person’s words are somewhat ambiguous, presumably because of the relationship between the mouth and the tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here, I wish you all the heroic officers and gods happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ega Eugen ended his prayer seriously and suddenly turned into the usual cynicism, shouting: "Then, the long-awaited Flamingo Contest can finally begin!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of cheers and whistles came from under the stage, and there was a shout of "very respected lord!" Although the character is so arrogant, Lieutenant Colonel Eugen is a self-respecting patriarch who is unrelenting and recognized - the so-called "parson", who is highly respected because of his high morality and belief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't see it at all." The teenager whispered to himself, "Where is the god of magic and faith, besides magical magic?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But! Before that, there was a very regrettable news to tell you." The lieutenant colonel bowed his head and put a very regrettable expression. "Because of us." Some mistakes in the abominable logistics department, the firebirds we collected this year are not enough for the competition. Therefore, we have to reduce the fighting events and group competitions that are used by the firebirds. The boring team competition does not say, but you must see Not a cute, sexy, stimulating, exposed woman fight score. Let us mourn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a tidal whistle, mixed with The protests and screams of some female soldiers - of course, not the cancellation of the protest women's wrestling scores, but the provocative speech of the Lieutenant Colonel. As the actual responsible person of the "detestable logistics department", the door is resistant; Soledon subconsciously shrinks his neck. Due to his lack of understanding of the "sublime tradition of the Free Army," he calculated about three hundred of the total number of firebirds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, it's not your responsibility. Logistics depends on the region and timing. We have so many people temporarily, we can't meet the requirements and it is normal." "Itis, who stood by his side and performed the task together; Magnum saw him like this and said a few words of comfort." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much was the final difference? Is your supply plan based on the proportion of the population in the region?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The two of them are monitoring the object, Liberation Knight Rasta suddenly asked, seems to be quite curious about this topic. After considering it for a moment, Naramen replied with some vigilance: "The exact amount cannot tell you, but the replenishment plan has a margin. The population around the fortress is enough to supply the fortress, just because the firebird is special supply. I didn’t get enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Rasta smiled slightly: "If you think so, it doesn't matter, the staff officer. If it is in our army, this The situation will definitely cause suspicion: in his own control area, the supply is not normally lacking, it proves that there must be some missing information or implementation. If I have not guessed wrong, it should be the lack of supply on the north side. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you obtained our data? I will report it truthfully." Itis captain, a loud reminder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, madam, if I steal your data, will you tell me here? This is just my personal tactical point of view." Frasal; Rasta's helpless face, "You don't have to bother with your anti-spyware department. If you are involved in innocent people, my conscience as a paladin will be uneasy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's your personal ability to report...so personally, I am very interested in listening to your analysis."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple. You must always monitor the Klad Army Camp in the southwest. There is no possibility of any omission in theory. The North Defense is solid, and it is naturally unavoidable to investigate. If there is any information missing. Naturally, there is a high probability of appearing on the north side. I personally estimate that there is a 30% chance.” The Paladin did not say a firm guess like a counselor, but used the odds to make a rational judgment. “If I am The commander, now has a 30% chance of danger, just .. Not the organization of this size entertainment once in these three people to be pre-emptive, it will be very tragic fate of the "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"First of all, in terms of interests, the benefits of breaking through here are 100%. As long as you capture or kill Radz; Govar, the civil war will automatically end. And in terms of possibility, if the character is adventurous, then Formulating a flash plan, this chance is 50%. When the timing is, Shenlin Festival is a good time, the chance of choosing this is 70%. 0.5 times 0.7, in fact, there should be 30%." Rasta replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But logically, it is impossible to have large-scale enemy troops nearby. In any case, the time is not enough. The Fabians will adjust all the main forces. Come here - I believe that the intelligence of your country has not found any signs of laxity in the northern border defense. If you take the difficulty of implementation, how much is left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Liberation Cavaliers smiled confidently: "In our hypothesis, we don't consider the difficulty of execution. As long as the executor and the team are determined, what kind of plan can be worked out. As long as the enemy decides to attack the fortress on the night of the gods, Then you can put it into execution - the success rate is another."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, the most important thing is the efficiency and results of the implementation! There is no success rate. Plan, how can someone go to perform?!" Rebellion stammered, which is incompatible with the tactical theory he had studied before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, determination is the most important. Any plan can be worked out, and the outcome depends only on the choices of both parties. When you all feel that the plan has no success rate. At that time, it has a success rate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this fresh argument, the door is shocked, the lips are moving, and you can’t pick up the rebuttal. vocabulary. If you assume the actions of the enemy, this theory will indeed be more comprehensive, but also more...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are all assumptions based on the fact that the enemy will use unconventional tactics? If this is the case... unless all the commanders consisting of light cavalry and magical users are chosen, this attack on a tightly guarded fortress is not allowed in the Freedom of the Army regulations. Is there really a chance of that 35 percent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resistance! Itis! The game is about to start, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Major Cousin’s shouts came from a distance. Naimeng shook his head and pressed the faint uneasiness in his heart to the field of the Flamingo Contest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first project is a physical sniper race. It is forbidden to use magic. There is no limit to the type of weapon! Eight players are invited, please select the team quickly!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd moved to the high pillars and listened to the command of Lieutenant Colonel Eugen. The tone of the lieutenant colonel is very exciting, and it seems that he likes this lively occasion. The strong sergeants tied the flamingo to one high pillar and then stood them up. Taking advantage of this time, the majors, captains and lieutenants of the staff immediately began to chat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the representative of us participating in this competition?" Nana was routinely staring at Rasta and asked Captain Itis around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sain; Constance." Next to another captain, "Because he is the only one of the rest who can't magic, so take the initiative to sign up." Participate in this event."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh? The weapon he is very good at Major Constance is? Bows, flying knives or knives?" Lieutenant continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pistol." Isis replied, "There are so many members of the staff who will not be magical. Only one of them will follow us here, no reason." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pistol? But can the pistol's lead bomb hit a small fire sac?" Resist the door and touched the pistol at his waist. The precision of this handle is limited to less than ten meters. If it is more than ten meters, it will only take chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, my pistol is different from those of your amateurs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tone of the gendarmerie major is quite proud of his tone, and his tone of coldness or anger and complaints is completely different. Resistence found that Major in Thain’s hands was playing with a handgun. I don't know why, seeing that thing, the door is reflective and wants to call it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most eye-catching is the large caliber barrel, obviously only the use of homemade lead bombs, the door can not think of which standard weight lead can be lost Go in. Unlike his well-designed black pistol, the gun has two barrels juxtaposed together and looks very deterrent. The length of the barrel is close to half that of a normal arquebus. Because it is too long, there are extra handles and weight wooden handles on the back. This kind of thing can't be described as a "pistol" at all, and can only be described as a "hand gun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was stunned by the new gun and gave way to Major Constance. The gendarmerie major smiled in a rare way, sat down on the small stool at the end of the white line, measured the distance, and waited for the order to start the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, there are staff members in the competition, the first to fourth regiments of the tenth division, the northern garrison and the southern garrison, and the fleet of marines, Are the players all here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant Colonel Eugen finally named it once. Since the nightmare of Lenny, the "team" level of the 10th Division has been almost jokes, even if the original Lenny defending troops were incorporated into only 4,000 people. A group of one thousand people... It may be more appropriate to say that it is a bigger camp. Naimen noticed that at least two of the players were members of the Assault Corps team he knew - probably some groups no longer had the stalwart and corporal soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, next to our top commander, Radz; Lord Margaret, announce the beginning of the game!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radz; Govard walked to the center of the simple podium with a few strong sergeants, and Eugen immediately used his magic to protect the marshal. Resist the door to pay attention, every few days, every time, the gray hair of the Marshal’s head turned white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The officers and men, and this year's Shennong Festival! Although this year's situation is somewhat special, the tradition of our Free Army will not change... I announced that the Flamingo Contest is now starting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is surging, accompanied by the tsunami-like cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the exit, Marshal Govar looked around for a week, and when he glanced at the Viscount Rasta, he paused. The liberation of the knight's gaze and the old marshals intersected, smiled, raised his hand, and respected an imperial fingertip; Margaret Gowar hesitated, responded with a note and turned and walked down the rostrum. Nanamen saw that Rastad seemed to talk to himself, but could not hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the game has started, the huge roar of gunpowder has overwhelmed the noise around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Constance was the first to win, and the double-barreled handgun fired first. The huge recoil was in his hand and he had to step back two steps to stabilize his figure. The people around them were shocked by this momentum for a moment, their respective weapons lost their heads, and the arrows and bows were mostly slanted to the wooden wall behind the pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant Colonel Eugen spoke in the mouth and exclaimed with excitement: "Oh! Look at our gendarmerie captain Sain; Major Constance is earth-shattering." A shot! First introduce to the fortress guards, Sain; Major Constance is known as amateur firearms researcher in the staff department. At the time, he had to transfer to the military equipment department... It really is a well-deserved reputation! Look at the results, He ignited accurately..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke dissipated, revealing the wooden pillar. There is already a firebird on it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crowd, there was a loud voice. Even the Lieutenant Colonel's commentator, who had a lot of words, couldn't make a sound for this amazing result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...because of Thain; Constance interrupted the relationship between the column and canceled his qualifications. Others continued the game. The firebird recovered, used In the next game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three flamingos who fell to the ground with the upper half of the column struggled to scream out to show their gratitude. The high pillars next to it began to appear fire and smoke, and the archers returned to their normal state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy went back to the gendarmerie in a dark face, not even watching the game behind." As another major in the staff, The second staff member Peter; Cousin was gloating to send Major Constance to leave. "Sure enough, to give our direct troops back to face, or to rely on magic-free competition. Where are the regiments and pastors who can be with us?" "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the next appearance is Peter you?" Naomi asked with interest, "Throw the sniper? This and What is the difference between physical sniper games?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course there is a difference." Major Cousin helped the glasses. "You can't use guns, bows or arrows in this game." Everyone can only use darts - but can be assisted by magic. I have been preparing for the detection and enhancement of magic, and I can see it in the position of the fireball inside the pile of birds!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that someone is faster than him. When he judged the position of the fire sac, a naval lieutenant standing in his right hand had already thrown a dart. Two rounds of eight, one of which hit through the mesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, unfortunately, but using multiple darts at once is not a foul. You can use the guiding magic to guide the darts. There is nothing to say to others. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the judgment of the boss, Master Cousson had to retire to the side. Although the second place score is much better than Constance, it was immediately pressed by the next player. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unlimited sniper start! Let us look forward to the only female seed player, 'The Empress of the Era', Isis; Captain Magnum! She is continuous Two years of the All-Army Magic Shooting Championship!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "unrestricted sniper" has always been a singapore, shadow mage, sealer and other professionals The occasion of strengths. Traditionally, the most important thing in this event is not the speed or accuracy of the player, but the obstacles that hinder others. At the beginning of the game, there were two dark magics, a layer of solid fog, and a thin force field alternately built on the empty field in front of the firebird, covering the firebird behind these barriers. Every Master from Lenny has heard of the "Ray Goddess" Itis; Magnum's name; they decided to seal her rays first, and then use their own magic to decide the outcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Isis did not give them this opportunity. The two lights that popped up on the index finger first hit a light-transparent hole on the dark screen, followed by two pops and ice waves from the middle finger to break the solid fog and force field. People haven't seen what her ring finger rays are. The two flamingos in front of Isis have already exuded the aroma of barbecue. After that, she leisurely turned and left, leaving the seven lonely professionals to clean up the mess - at this time they are still hurting to lift other people's magic obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followingly, it was the cheers of "Long live for Itis!" throughout the arena, and the performance of the female captain fully satisfied the expectations of the audience. Only a few people will seriously think about the techniques used by Itis - such as the Liberation Knights from the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technique of concentrating many different magical rays on different fingers seems to have left a deep impression on the Viscount Rasta: "She The super-magic technique used is... multiple rays? Or is it a legendary trigger or a storage magic? A rare trick, I have never seen a few people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... this, please forgive me." Although I knew nothing about the technique of Itis, Nana answered him so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasta, then reacted: "Sorry, I lost my word. If you master such advanced magic skills, of course it is confidential. Have you signed up for it? Which project is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no end to it: "Oh... if you cancel two projects, then the next one It must have been my registration..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not yet fallen, Lieutenant Colonel Eugen announced the beginning of the next project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All personnel cleared the field and retired to the white line outside the playground! The logistics company removed the 220 pieces of firebirds saved and put them in. On the floor! Pastors who are not ready to participate, trouble to arrange a simple fire enchantment at the edge of the venue... The indiscriminate group fight is about to begin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Two hundred and twenty?? Is the practice not one hundred?" someone asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because we canceled the group guards, our staff urgently decided to change this fight to a freely contested group competition. The teams were originally prepared to participate in the group. The players of the competition can participate, the gender is not limited, and finally calculate the score of the whole team! The participants quickly go to the priest to mark the fire enchantment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard This sentence, Major Cousson, who was slamming in the corner, jumped up: "Eugan this guy... He made his own claim! Sure enough, he could not entrust him with any transactional work... eight teams, four Ten players will be messed up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? This is not very interesting? Are you going to quit, Cousin?" Itis stared at the library. Asked Major Sen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter; Cousin’s face was red and red, and he shook his head resolutely: "Who said it? Of course I have to participate! Otherwise, Colonel Eugen affirmed It will do something like a sneak peek at the fire enchantment of others by using flame magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing of Isis's invitation, the captains of the immediate troops immediately jumped up and fought to join the team. But at this time, another person spoke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the beautiful captain and the young lieutenant are going to the competition, who will perform the surveillance mission? This is not appropriate." Rasta’s speech Full of knighthood, unsuspecting people will never think that he is the target of surveillance missions. However, this reasonable statement made both Nymen and Itis bothered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s also...I won’t participate.” Nana immediately seized the opportunity to fight back, and he didn’t like the abuse of small animals. Competition activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount hurriedly waved his hand: "No, I don't mean this. I just want to propose to the beautiful Miss Captain, can you count me as a place? It was solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nelmen, Itis and Peter looked at each other and felt that the proposal was somewhat ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to ask the opinion of Lieutenant Colonel Eugen?" Ninmen proposed, "Will there be some... violation of the rules?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard and Peter sighed at the same time: "If you want to ask, just ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Oh? This is very interesting! Instead of picking those boring captains, let this guest join! I am licensed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ega; The roots were throwing new gum into the mouth and talking. His body has been covered with a layer of light red disposable fire glow, which is used to protect the safety of the players and determine the outcome. Upon hearing this opinion, Nana was surprised to say that he was stunned; and the captain and the major just patted him on the shoulder with sympathy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our lieutenant colonel, as long as it is interesting, will do it. He does not understand common sense."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Lieutenant Colonel Eugen jumped into the fire enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All contestants, enter the enchantment! The game begins immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: Freedom Army Compilation<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Army is an army that is approved and funded by the Federal Republic of the Union, and is composed of volunteers from the independent republics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest command of the Freedom Army belongs to the Joint Council. The actual command is jointly held by the Freedom Army Staff Conference and the commanders of all levels and the General Staff. The commander has the final The right to decide. The command form of the Free Army is the Chief Executive-Deputy, with no deputy chief. If the sergeant is unable to perform his or her tasks, he will replace his position with the chief staff officer, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Force must not attack civilians and property of the Federal Republic of the Republic without emergency and parliamentary approval. The republics and autonomous provinces and municipalities have the responsibility to replenish the Free Army, and the Free Army must pay in full for these replenishments. It is the responsibility of the Parliament to guarantee the military requirements of the Free Army with an annual budget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic establishment of the Free Army is a division, currently a total of 12. In principle, the divisions of the Free Army are organized in accordance with the combat effectiveness and importance, and are given priority allocation according to the serial number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard for each freelancer is 8,000 to 12,000 (four to six regiment). The standard of each regiment is 1,500 to 2,500 (the artillery company, the logistics company and the magic combat company are deployed at the regiment level, sometimes these units will be decentralized and continue to be decentralized), with three to five jurisdictions. Camp (battalion, standard preparation of about 450 people). Each battalion has three companies (pany, about one hundred and fifty people). In the square battle, even as an independent combat unit, it is generally deployed as five rows of battle lines, each with 30 people. In the squadron, each row is divided into three classes (squad, about ten people), each class is divided into three battle groups (bat team, three). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the overall strategic needs, the defending party is defined as the "front of the combat". At present, the main force of the Free Army is divided into the Ruhr (North The Frontal Army and the Faus (Northeastern Army) are two combat fronts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a strategic level, if more than two freelancers act together, they will be grouped into "corps." At the tactical level, different group units will be grouped into brigade. The frontiers, the legions, and the brigades are all informal units, and the chiefs are temporary appointments, but there are also staffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marshall: There is only one, the chairman of the Freedom Army Staff Conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French (freneral): Two to four, serving as the combat commander or "master of the army." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General: four to eight, serving as "the head of the army" or a class of liberal divisions - sometimes also appointing special forces or The chief of the military government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vice general: A general freelancer, or an important general who has no actual position for the time being.

It is also the honorary rank of some senior garrison magicians or pastors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lieutenant Colonel der): Chief of the Chief of Staff or the rank of "Brigadier". It is generally the most important person in the military staff, and almost all the actual executives of the Free Army are in this class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major r): The rank of senior staff officer or head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain (cap: rank of senior staff officer or battalion commander.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;中尉(lieute: ordinary The rank of the chief of staff or the company commander, the backbone of the officer at the bottom.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lieutenant (sublieute: the rank of the trainee or the non-commander's caster.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The officers and men dividing line-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;master sergeant: If the company commander does not pass the officer’s examination, this is Military rank.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saff sergeant: platoon leader.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergeant: Guards and technicians, as well as veterans with excellent combat skills. A common saying circulating in the Free Army is the “strong sergeant” to show the backbone of this class. The duties are extremely diverse.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporal: The squad leader, and the soldiers with first-class combat performance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private: ordinary soldiers.<br / ><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recuit: newly recruited soldiers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free Military Division list (see the location for a specific location... ...the combat power is arranged in the order of the serial numbers, named after the place name):<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first division "republics" ("republics"): the Confucian army north striker unit, Steele Fortress defends.
