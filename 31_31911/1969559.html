			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ix<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day will dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor on duty who was driven from the bed was standing at the top of the main mast and slumbering to monitor the movements in the nearby sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a faint green light flashed into his eyes from the eastern horizon. He picked up the telescope and just caught up with the dazzling green light from his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? Looking at the hand and slamming the bell: "Seeing the shining lighthouse! You have entered the sea of ​​Sansen!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Emperor Klein" woke up in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report one pass, from the sailor on duty to the third officer, from the third officer to the captain of the sea corps, from the captain of the sea corps to the first officer, in the fourth transfer After arriving in the hands of the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone who heard this news immediately cheered and the sleepiness was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All get up! Deck emergency collection!" Ferron did not hesitate to release this order - because it has already shined the lighthouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shreen lighthouse, which shines with a green glow, stands proudly at the entrance to Emerald Bay and is guided by his eye-catching green light beam. The route of the vessel. It is built on an artificial floating island made up of floating soil and vegetation and looks like a huge crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legend has it that this floating island was created by the great magicians of the Age of the Elves. It was built in the era of the Elven Empire and has been hailed as "the greatest building ever built" and "the end of the extreme West" for a long time. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the lighthouse was responsible for the guidance of a large part of the offshore route on the west coast of the Old World. It is close to several major ports in the Emerald Bay. As long as the southwest trade winds have not subsided, it takes only two days from the lighthouse to the elven port of Elliport, the free port of the free country, and only five days and nine days to the free port of Vendure and the free port of Lesport. . The lighthouse continued to function until the end of the nineteenth century, but it increased the power of lighting several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, seeing the shining beacon lighthouse means that the annoying journey is finally over. Crossing the lighthouse, it entered the scope of the activities of the first offshore fleet of Sansen, the territorial waters of the Elven countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors will soon gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this voyage, although we did not annihilate the record, there is almost no sacrifice! There is no death in the process of crossing the entire ocean, this is Sansen A miracle in the history of the Navy! We will continue to be closely united around the Command of the Two Seas Fleet headed by Admiral Churchill..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain's The sound echoed on the deck, and there was a slap in the face. Listening to the boring instructions of the iron wall admiral Fei Long, Leonard couldn't help but yawn, disdainfully grinning: "If it is a beautiful captain's training, it is better. This kind of uncle training can't improve morale. No death. Isn't it by relying on a number of shipmen and pastors who are out of standard? If it is not a secret mission..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training is really long. In particular, the following essays that are ridiculously written in the Old Elvish, have no practical meaning, and are listed in the order of one, two, three, four, five, six, are most unbearable. Some historians have verified that the ancient elf empire died in Arthur; the hands of the Uighurs led by Kirman could not be related to this bureaucratic style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the sailors of the offshore fleet who were not used to listening to the training began to fall asleep, yawn, rub their fingers, and lick their nostrils. Leonard did not intend to take care of them at all - anyway, his relationship with the captain is now in a state of basic breakdown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the captain’s speech is finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...All crew members must wake up! Although they have reached the civilized world, it does not mean that our mission is over! Well known, Emerald Bay, Xinzhou The sea and the land of the sea are also known as the three major pirate areas. The nearby private pirates and pirate ships are the most! Always wake up and not be attacked. Our mission is not over yet! For the Saskatchewan, go forward!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they announced the end of the training, they were scattered, and the first-class baron had to return to his cabin, and his back was a bit lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that he is still not used to the environment of the offshore fleet... The training of the offshore fleet is not useful here." Leonard sighs In a tone, one person went to the front deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf raised his head and looked at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is already bright... It seems a bit conservative. To be exact, the sun is already shining straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He actually said it for so long... It’s really the official residence of the offshore fleet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He vented the anger of listening to so many garbage reports, and he looked around. After entering the Emerald Bay, all the sails on the ship were halfway, which was to make it easier to turn. Relative to the vast outer sea, the reefs and ships of the Emerald Bay are quite numerous, and full sails without any spare capacity are not suitable for this sea area. As the sails fell, the ropes on the deck increased significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom!" A cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the cannon came from the bow. Leonard avoided the ropes under his feet and the direct sunlight, and walked towards the bow in the shadow of the sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reesa; Hermonte is standing at the bow and debugging new parts of her Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ganda, left cannon, fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard the command of the alchemist, gold The devil's right knee is squatting and the left knee is turned open by himself. The gunpowder in the left leg was ignited by the organ, and a huge explosion sounded. A huge black shotgun was then sent straight ahead. The range is not very far, probably only equivalent to three pounds of light cannon, but it is quite amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linard leaned on the front main mast and watched her keep performing various performance tests and recordings. The expression was very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two days to go to the beach... It seems that she has already completed this work. This time, it’s going to end again. Ah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf smiled a bit. As before, she will also be quietly in the corner of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mixed-race children at sea have no time to stay, and they have no possibility of observing others; they are not accepted by humans and are not accepted by elves. The best result is nothing but a warm night, more of a mere confession, and there are many opportunities for confession. Then, everyone keeps the other person in memory and never sees each other again in their lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to confess? Go, or not, this is really a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lenard’s little finger in the left hand kept hitting the hilt of the sword at the waist. Intuition tells him that confession is likely to fail, and the woman obviously does not invest emotionally or even with a bit of attention. If you don't go, I am afraid I will continue to regret it... He hesitated, walking around the mast, and the pace rushed unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really trouble...how do you want to confess..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he The sole of the foot stepped on a round object, and the foot slipped and fell suddenly. A scream and a scream rang at the same time: Fortunately, Reza had just fired a cannon on her right leg, and the explosion of gunpowder covered the scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the woman’s screams were heard, the captain of the sea squad looked at it and saw two legs hidden in the rope pile under the shadow. No need to look at the face, he knows who is hiding here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are lazy again, Anne; Miss Sefer. Isn't it time to go to the kitchen to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" It hurts and hurts..." The blonde girl got up from the ropes and had an exaggerated painful expression on her face. "Is this kind of person who should step on the person to say it? Ah...ah...the leg seems to be broken!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is that you are lazy Ah.” Leonard glanced at her leg, making sure she was just bluffing; he was already used to the exaggeration of this cheerful girl. "Would you like me to tell Ms. Hermont? Or, let the three-legged cat trainer Nopp come over and give you a bone? If it doesn't break, it will break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Er..." I thought of the dishes that Bonnie had been cooking since I started cooking, and then I thought about the dishes before. In comparison, the sea corps captain's esophagus prompted him to make a decision. "Still... forget it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then don't bother me to sleep... very sleepy, sailing is very tired..." said, Anne It smashed back like a snail. "The lady sent a very heavy life, but she also had to use a sword like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up, I haven't got a nap yet. Time. Since there is nothing, practice two rounds with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard’s tone is very dull, but Annie is as fierce as a cat stepping on the tail. Bouncing: "Ha? What do you say? Practice... What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swordsmanship. Should you carry a short scimitar with you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Annie touched the weapon next to her knee. "But, but with you? How could I have played?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it, it’s the final test before graduation. Go to the back deck, It’s a bit more spacious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay." Annie stood up listlessly. "The test is on the test..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard frowned. "Hey, Miss Sefer, it’s a little more serious. It’s better, if If I win, I can ask you one thing; you win the same. How can this condition motivate? I only use my left hand and no right hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I do this? This is not to make sure that I will lose? Let a hand be too small, can you make more..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leonard gave her a serious look. "I believe in your own strength. If you decide that you will lose before the battle, you will lose. Your talent is very good, and you can become a real warrior - but before that, you must survive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s heart stunned and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard; Kakawi took a thick leather case from his pocket and placed it on the tip of his elf sword. The black leather case has a blade. Half of it is long. The stabbing sword is a weapon that is extremely easy to cause fatal injuries. He does not often use it; on weekdays, he also uses a short machete and arm shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't use my right hand. As long as you can meet me, even if you win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Then I don't need a scabbard." Anne picked up an oval arm shield from the side and tied it to the left hand arm. "Exactly, there are pastors here, and there is no need to worry about general injuries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Leonard glanced side to side and saw the bishop and him. The students are all there. "The two come to be really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It happens to pass. The two are in...duress? Or practice?" Bishop Belber asked. Leonard served as the two maid swordsman instructors, and everyone on the ship knew the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a quiz. The people under my hand are going to give them two lights, and they have to go out in person." The captain of the sea squad smiled and took the handle. The sword is held in the left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His stabbing sword is about four feet long and quite amazing; the side has a two-way thin blade, which has a clear advantage over a short scimitar that is only two feet long. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nonsense, there are not a few guys who are serious about fighting." Anne confirmed that the shield was very strong and pulled out his short scimitar from the waist. . "I am ready, I can start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard looked at her posture and nodded and said: "After more than two months of hard work, You have already had the momentum of a swordsman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... it’s really hard to practice..." The blonde girl answered with a bitter face . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men flexed their arms and, in accordance with established practice, let their swords touch each other three times, and the distance was right. Leonard took a deep breath and showed his left arm. He started the first round of stabs with the help of a long weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf's black tip is like a sensitive snake, bouncing on Annie's shield. His spurt relies only on the vibration of the left wrist and the elasticity of the blade, and the arm is almost motionless; the sound of the slap on the shield is like a drum, and the faster and faster it is knocked. The sooner. The afterimage of Jian Yu covered all the upper body of the other chest to the thigh, forcing Anne to move the left arm to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This man... is it serious?" Young trainee pastors can't help but worry about blonde girls. "The other party is just a little girl who has been learning swordsmanship for two months!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, but he said that the woman’s talent is definitely true. Actually, relying on an arm shield for so long, a quick response, a good observation. Ms. Hermonte sees their potential to let them learn swordsmanship?" Bishop Belber indulged, "She Who is it? Golem, alchemy, if..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should not, teacher, you probably have more thoughts." The trainee pastor smiled. "My instinct, they will not be enemies... Ah, there will be no force to pick such a confused, flawed person as a spy. Our opponents are all known for their shrewdness, such as the Secretary of State. , the cursed half-elves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not yet fallen The pain of Anne’s pain caught the attention of the two, and the situation on the field was changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf's sword tipped first all the way up, tempting Anne's shield completely in the upper body defense; then slammed down and stabbed on her calf. Although this thorn did not pierce her leather armor, the strength was sufficient. The girl's knees are soft, and half a step back, the half-elves are approaching and seem to have taken the victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going to be bruised?" Pastor Pastor looked at her with sympathetic eyes. "I didn't seize the opportunity to get closer to the inside. It's hard to do now." Unless..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard is another spur, Centered above the Annie Arm Shield. This thorn seems to use too much power, even piercing the shield with a leather case! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, how can you wear it?" He glanced. Unconsciously, did you use such a big force? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of his glimpse, Anne seized the opportunity, the right hand blade slammed on the strap on the left arm, and the left arm turned back again. The shield immediately took Leonard's stabbing sword together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this opportunity, the girl grabbed further, her wrist turned, and the scimitar in her hand went straight to the throat of the half-elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Decisively, good!" The half-elf applauded, left his hand to abandon the sword, one side of the body, flashing Anne's tip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about this trick?" The girl’s straight thorns then turned into a cross, chasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, I won't admit defeat!" Leonard's head was low, rolling down the ground, swept his right leg and hit the opponent's The calf broke her balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good treacherous!" Annie stumbled back three steps to stabilize her body, complaining angrily, but it was too late to stop the half-elf from picking up her own weapons. . The two re-formed their confrontation, but this time they exchanged positions. One left hand holds the Elf fine sword, and the other left arm is habitually held on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You used your legs and violated the rules!" The girl protested angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only said that I don't have to use my right hand, didn't I say I don't need a right leg?" The half-elf laughed. "You have no shield, don't you lose?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well... I admit defeat, what is your request?" Anne said as she squatted down her leg and checked the redness on her calf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me come." On the side of the trainee pastor Nopp walked over to her, gathered a micro-injury treatment curse on the palm of his hand, patted gently At her wounds. "minor cure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain at the congestion is quickly dissipated. After thanking him, Annie stood up and put the shield back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intersection...that is, Bonnie, she has passed your test?" The blonde girl asked with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's basic ability is better than you, but in the end I didn't force me to abandon the sword." Leonard replied, "According to your two current standards, The fighting part of the sensational martial arts test should be no problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, his words were interrupted by the steel bell ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, two, it’s time to eat." The middle-aged bishop took a clap and said. "Right, Mr. Kakawi, should there be no problem for lunch today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf would smile with one heart: "There is one here, the other is at the bow." What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne has a red face but can't refute it. In the matter of cooking, her technique is quite similar to her master's level - the difference is that one knows that she is completely okay in this aspect, and the other does not know it. She turned her head to the side and didn't want to listen to the men's arguments, but saw that the trainee pastor was holding the shield he had just used for combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, you should have dinner," she reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Ah, have a meal, good, good." The trainee pastor put down the shield, sinking for a moment, turned around and smiled at her. "The quality of this shield seems to be really not very good, one side is thick, one side is thin. And the thickness is not evenly strange..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... If the warrior used this shield, it would be terrible. However, for my test, this is also a good luck?" Anne felt a chill in the absence of a rush and began to change the subject. She felt that this smile seemed to have been seen. "Mr. Kekawi, we should have dinner too..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, wait a minute." Leonard cocked his right index finger and gently rocked it. Heading, "And one thing you should promise me, Anne; Miss Sefer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the captain of the sea corps was heard, the priests immediately borrowed The name of lunch is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annies shrank back: "I said good in advance, even on this boat, you are the only man who calls me and my sister to call it. Ask for excessive rewards! Otherwise I will tell the distinguished lady to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, ah, of course..." The half-elf is coping. His brow wrinkled into a ball and struggled for a long time before he made his request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two days to go to the beach. You help me think about it. Is there any good way to confess to Reza?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?! confession? Are you really serious?" Upon hearing this request, Anne’s face had a weird look. That face is obviously saying, "All men who look good and have a good-looking ear and are slender ears are playboys." "How can this guy want to be responsible?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I look a lot like casual people?" The half-elf was angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like." The blonde girl did not hesitate to answer. "I don't think Miss Lisa will have a crush on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves look like they are being hammered: "I am far away every day." Watching her silently, watching the night for her on duty, suppressing the opinions of the sailors, and praising every meal she made... Isn't that okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This last point, it is really amazing." Annie sighed sincerely. But she dare to bet that Reza must have neglected the man’s goodwill towards her – what he did was “reasonable” for alchemists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, this, then, Miss Anne, is there really no chance? Is there any special clever way to save..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie sighed and replied: "You and she have known each other for two months. I don't have to ask me about this person who has only stayed for half a month?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking that I spent two months together, I didn’t really talk a few times. I usually have no chance to contact... Anyway, I really don’t understand much. Woman." Lenod smiled with a look of self-deprecating. "In short, you know her, definitely more than I know about her. I am a half-elf..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
