Among the ruins, you can see many citizens, businessmen, and craftsmen who came back from the refuge. They vainly searched for the ruins of their own homes, trying to save something that they could use. However, there are still a lot of ruins on the ruins, because their owners will never come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the round, her footsteps gradually slowed down. This is not a war, but it has caused countless tragedies - perhaps not countless, but at least a thousand tragedies. People suffer from the grief of losing property, the grief of losing their loved ones, the grief of losing their health, and even losing their lives until there is no grief... In the next era of war, people of this era have to bear several times, no, dozens More than this grief. In order to defend the troops assembled by the republics, almost all have been lying in the pool of blood, or regrouped in the prison camp. Lenny, already an almost undefended city; the last two Freedom Forces in the vicinity, but also each other, each defending their own beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is really uncontrollable, as long as a small factor changes, it will not return to the original track. Although they have worked hard, the people in this city still pay a heavy price. Even if there are fewer dead and wounded, how can this city with almost no defenses resist the elite of the tiger? The silence around them seems to be laughing at them and telling them that you should not have existed in this era, and you should not interfere with this inherent destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reese walked slowly and tried to find something other than grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that some houses have chimneys that have risen again. The plasterers, bricklayers, carpentry, and more from the nearby villages have come to the wind and have invested in the reconstruction of these four or five streets. The clerics with the Protestant Concentric Ring logo shuttled on the streets to protect people's bodies and souls; the mages used their various magics to do semi-public welfare relief, hoping to change some of them. One year's allowance. The citizens who have not suffered from the loss have formed a self-policing group under the leadership of enthusiastic volunteers to maintain order in the damaged area and to extinguish the Mars that has not been extinguished. With a huge sacrifice, more than a quarter of the Lenny police have also taken action, or riding or walking, patrolling the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People burned the filth of the old era and burned the glory of the old times; they wanted to build a new era, but they could not find the direction they deserved. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese suddenly remembered a previous summary of the Age of Enlightenment. There are many times like the Enlightenment era filled with endless disasters, but no era is as full of hope as this era. Even after repeated disasters, people are still trying to seek reason and progress – just like those who rebuild order and home on the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more she goes to the center of the city, the less the silence is filled with grief, the more vibrant the voice. She heard an unspeakable huge snoring, uploaded from the Freedom Square in the center of the city; the already slowed pace gradually accelerated again and accelerated until it became a run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the Liberty Square, the Freedom Square, once shrouded in war and smoke - the Freedom Square, which has been filled with bloody young people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw a huge banner of "recruitment" hanging on the base under the foot of "Shuangweiren Sculpture", young people crowded around, kept filling out forms and collecting Equipment, join the army. Two statues are on the opposite side of the square: it was the first president to establish the Republic, and Conti, who captured Steelburg in the fourth free war; Marshal Fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hearing the call of the motherland? Citizens, armed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One The march that has not yet been made, quietly ringing in the heart of Reese, is getting louder and louder and louder. What if you have not guarded the army here? What if the parliamentary politics is going on? What if only half of the people have voting rights? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as there are such enthusiastic citizens, how can the city be lost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She unfolded the "coup map" that had been completely transformed into history: the vast majority of the red flames above did not occur as "history." There is no fate in this world, and I never admit my fate. Destiny is only the reverie of the girls, the excuses of the incompetent, and the excuse of the pessimists. He is only determined by people's character, ability and will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you give me another reason... I will make up my mind." She shook her head violently and continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Grace's Welfare Home still stands in the corner of the East Third District, just with some lead particles and gunpowder-stained scars on the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese went to the door and re-examined the tracking magic: I was really here. She gently pushed open the door that was only one-third of the door and walked into the yard, but it just happened to hit someone. As soon as she looked at the human face, she exclaimed; the man rushed forward, covering her mouth and pulling her out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was actually an "Annie; Seifer" who was alive and well - that is, she herself! She took Real Ress and walked to the dark alleys nearby until she confirmed that no one would follow me until she stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry, I used magic to make you look!" "Anne" immediately apologized and lifted the magic of her body and restored her true colors. "It's me, 黛妮卡!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonica?! Since you are back, why do you want to pretend to be like me?" The answer that has long been expected, the doubts in Reese's mind have not been reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... um..." 黛 卡 一 , , , , , , 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一Don't believe it. I am going to leave here soon, I am afraid... will be a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave? Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I have no way to face Clade...oh, my..."Father." I don't know what expression to use to face the man who made up his mind to sacrifice me. I really don't know." The expression on Yanika's face was a little confused, but her eyes showed a faint firmness and reluctance. "Either for him or for me, as 'Jinica; Lopez' I am already dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss looks at the girl in front The eyes swallowed back into the stomach with the words that I intended to persuade. She knows that it will definitely not be useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I accidentally encountered a team of missing Masters The team, they said that I can join." Yanika smiled. "Don't worry about me, how can I say that I also have the mage of the cursed 'genius blood'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I seem to be saying... bon voyage, 黛nica; Lopez, my friend." Reese grabbed her hair with her left hand and extended her right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 smiled bitterly and reached out; the girls’ palms clasped together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a nickname; Lopez, I will call me nickica from now on; dalvelen." She corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment to hear the name, a faint impression flashed over Reese’s mind. This name reminds her of a place name that will be known to everyone in later generations. It should be just a coincidence. She shook her head and expelled the useless association from her mind and asked another question that bothered her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, when did you learn the magic of perfection? Just now I thought I came across another one, you even My details, little movements and intonations are all vividly learned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perfect disguise" is classified as a six-segment arcane, dedicated to To disguise "real existence of individuals." There are many magics that can change your appearance and body, but most of them can only hide their own appearance, or gain the ability of other bodies; but Yi Rong can really make the caster into another person, almost Will not leave any flaws. Even at the end of the 19th century, this magic was strictly controlled because it caused too much confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you heard Reese’s question, 黛妮卡 愣 愣 “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来 原来The trick was that I invented it... Sure enough, it’s not so easy to invent a magic.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You mean...” Reese was taken aback. "You invented?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's okay... I can create a magic that my predecessors have created, and it's amazing." Reese screamed and ran his own memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which year is the perfect era of perfection? It seems to be the middle of the Age of Enlightenment. 1660s? 1670? Or, there is a great possibility, this It was the first use of the magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly reacted: 黛妮卡's words are not boastful. With this magic, in this world, there are really few people who have the ability to hurt her. She can mix in any group of people at any time without being seen - not for a newly invented magic. Any countermeasures or counter-magic. In front of her, what a genius is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Reese wakes up the memory of the "future", Seneca looses her hand: "Okay, I have to go, my companions I am still waiting for me. Today I have to identify the corpse, Soledon has not come back yet, I am a little worried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss disdain Grinning: "The guy? Should he heal or sleep in a church? I met him at the Cathedral of Fortilla yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Maybe?” Renee said. “He had brought the nun’s wedding ring to me last night!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss stunned and immediately recalled The wrong delivery and the brave ensign last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there an error-free delivery on that ring?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Renee answered. "If I didn't have it, I was dead last night. But I can't remember now that Soledon is How did you hand it over to me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reese suddenly realized that the ensign that she saw last night was the humble young boy Soledon. It turned out that he is not entirely a coward who is greedy and greedy. Can he be a good man for his favorite girl, is it a good man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and decided the beauty of the adult: "I suggest you go to the prison camp to find it. He is probably crying to find someone to bail him. Last night I I saw that the encircled troops finally surrendered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Thank you!" Seneca bowed and ran away in a gust of wind. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riss looked at the back of his friend and waved goodbye and turned to go home. The faint morning fog has dissipated, and the bright sunshine hit the body, dispelling some chill. It is good to see a lover who is a genus, she thinks from later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be like a bastard, disappointing the girl's affection!" She waved her fist toward the sky and made up her mind. A world with so many wonderful things... Why not protect it? At the same time, Soleton, who was forgotten by everyone, was wearing the Lieutenant’s uniform of the Freedom Army, kneeling in a narrow corner, staring at the emptiness in front of him. . Looking to the left, the left side is full of dejected rebel officers and soldiers. Looking to the right, the right side is also a dejected rebel soldier. In the air, there is a desperate atmosphere like despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can it be like this? The teenager clung to his head and felt strongly helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resistance to the door! Resist the door; Seleton is less!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear female voice Calling his pseudo-famous name, he felt even more helpless. God, my God! How can we make these people understand that he is not a Lieutenant of the Free Army at all, and he should not be here at all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave me! Release me! I have nothing to do with it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He really wants to shout so loudly, but he doesn't have the guts. He has never missed his daily peaceful life and his own little happiness as he does now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right; Sorrenton, what are you doing here? Didn't you hear the collective password?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful female officer wearing a uniform and a heroic look suddenly appeared in front of him, his face was very impatient. Soledon swallowed and staggered and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got up and stood up, he felt a little dizzy. He stumbled and followed the female officer. On the way, he saw the soldiers who had been controlled by magic last night. He felt a little gratified to see that they were still alive. At this moment, the female officer who was walking in front suddenly stopped; Soledon did not pay attention, and the whole man slammed into her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah!" She slipped her foot and fell forward. The boy hurriedly pulled her. The soft jade scented into his arms and his face was red. When she stood firm, she let go of her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." The woman's face was reddish, and she set off the curtain of the room. "Go in, the big man is waiting for you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton hesitated a little, took a deep breath and walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the door to the door; the second son of Soledon? The commander of the remnants of the Lenni defending army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager strives to recall the kiss of the military population seen in the novel in the past: "Hey...just, it’s under."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to be so nervous I am not trying to pursue your failure, it is not your responsibility. On the contrary, I would like to recognize your outstanding character and ability as a commander." "The big man" said with his majestic voice, "Maybe. You still don't know me, I introduce myself. I am your highest commander--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton looked up and looked at the gray front The old man. On the shoulders of his military uniforms, carrying a huge unmistakable golden four-pointed star! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Ladz; Marshal Govar. From today, you are a member of my staff headquarters, commanding the reorganized Lenny's assault company. Congratulations, you are less - no, now it is lieutenant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..." Soledon smiled in his heart and raised his hand to salute. God... how could it be like this! He shouted at all the gods he knew in his heart, but he did not get a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship is still bumping and will soon arrive at Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 8, 1665, due to his outstanding performance in the "Denni's disaster", Naimen; the second son of Soledon entered the coup headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, history continues to flow, but in a completely different way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did our young wizard, Miss, not come back, go back and take the laundry for so long?" The burly middle-aged pastor stood at the door of the hotel, anxiously waiting. By his side, it was already packed bags and horses, all of which left a long shadow in the setting sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so anxious... Ah, you see, come back." The young and powerful Paladin looked at a lonely, thin figure in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 went to them and swept it again. These four are her new teammates, wandering adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian of Lesardo, the serious young holy knight, Shulan; the shulan del. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the god of war, Correll, like the joke of the cheerful uncle Jeter; jeton on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young thieves who are good at traps and assassinations, lonely and reticky Parker; pick tap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful and clean Musika pastor, Leifu; Navrok (levrok) is the only woman in this team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it back, 黛妮卡; Wei Lun? Hey... are you okay?" Seeing her footsteps low, the female pastor rushed to come forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 揉 blinked and hid his tears. The girl was strong and vigorously smiled and faced her new teammate: "I am back, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day, Reese is also in the city. It took a long time to return home until the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
