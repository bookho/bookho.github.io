			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-known military theorist said, "The plan is always better than the actual one, and the actual is always worse than the plan." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Renee; Wei Lun dragged his exhausted body and saw the light at the intersection of Shensen, it was already two o'clock in the morning on the 24th. When people reach the limit, the horse has reached the limit. As soon as they took off the "tired horseshoe", their mounts were all off, and fell to the ground - eight hours of full effort, will accumulate excessive fatigue for these poor animals. They handed the horse to the hotel's Ma Tong and staggered into the dimly lit hotel lobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These second-rate inferior horses will not be able to run this way, and they will not be worthy of our horseshoes. It’s a pity that my good breeders..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shackles, Seneca heard that the middle-aged man with her beard at the end of the team was whispering. She can understand his dissatisfaction: When a person wakes up from a coma and finds himself tied up in the immediate direction, he should be very angry when he keeps on bumping with the horse; if he wakes up and falls off, he should be even more angry. If he is still urging by others, and can't even complain about a few hours of night, it will not be too strange to break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, understanding and understanding, listening to this seemingly punctual, the girl still slightly snorted. Indeed, their horses are not very good, but she feels that this criticism seems to be saying that their team is "second-rate." Of course, her own driving skills are not very good, it may be dragging the progress of the team...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green hair woman who is at the forefront and still very spirited The ground stopped and turned around, striding close to the middle-aged gentleman, stopping him, and doing a mere reverence. Seeing her come, this gentleman who looks like a mighty gentleman has stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, I remind you that you need to pay attention to your speech. Complaints with dissatisfaction may spread through the team, causing great Trouble, please don't say this implicit pun. The order I received was to protect the credentials first, and secondly to be your safety; and all this security is pinned on these brave adventurers."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentleman shrank back and down, and it sounded a bit incoherent: "Oh, I, I understand, I won’t dare anymore... Hey, I Will be careful. But we are really wasting so much time, this will not cause danger, Little Lily, no... Ms. Maggie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No There will be too much danger. There will be a mysterious black knight chasing team tonight. The chance of killing outside the town is no more than 20%. Don't worry, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Oh... I, I understand." After the promise, the bearded gentleman walked into the lobby of the hotel with his head down. Dare look back look. He seems to be very afraid of this woman, very afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After deterring him, Lily; Maggie turned to Yanika with a charming gentle smile: "I apologize to you for his speech, young Miss Magician. He is not intentional, just a little annoyed. Can you please forgive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yenica’s brow stretched out and responded with a smile "Ah, it doesn't matter, I didn't pay attention to what he said..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, she was a little surprised. Is this charming woman in front of her eyes so eye-opening and listening to all directions? Even such small things can be noticed. Under what fascinating deep blue cicadas are, what kind of careful thoughts are there? The charming deep blue cicada...the charming deep blue cicada...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt that the noble lady in front was so honest and attentive So considerate, so trustworthy, as trustworthy as her other companions... No, maybe it’s as worthy of Soleden’s trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the boy’s name, she felt a slight pain. That night, she gave up and fled - so she lost him forever. She traveled all over the military camps, prison camps and temporary hospitals in the city of Lenny, and could not find him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I am not the first to kill today. I have killed the most important friends a long time ago. So, I should not tremble again. There is no reason to be afraid anymore..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja’s thoughts fluttered, noticing that the team had gone upstairs and entered the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Courageous and loyal adventurers, now I can tell you about our true identity and purpose. The one around me is the negotiating special envoy of the Kengal government, the first secretary of state and chairman of the Judicial Committee, Chase. Lord Chase Brighton. And I am the military commissioner responsible for his safety, Lily; Maggie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very weak man carefully I glanced at the woman around me and nodded. "Hey... I am Chase. Brighton is responsible for going to Lenny and negotiating with the interim government there."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the true identity of this mighty but cowardly man, two people bounced off the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kengler?! Negotiation Special Envoy?! It turned out to be you, isn't she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Leifu's mouth was wide open, staring at the man who had been inconspicuous and trembled in front of him. Take a closer look, this Chase; Brighton looks quite reliable, and probably has the kind of "politician's unique charm"; but after a continuous crisis and a hurry, his charm and momentum have disappeared. Save. She had always thought that this man was the steward or follow-up of the eye-catching woman...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the first state secretary and the chairman of the judicial committee serve as a special envoy?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person who jumped up and opened his mouth was Shulan; Dimartel, he was surprised by the identity of the special envoy. Sitting next to the knight, Jeter; although Niton was slightly surprised, he was not as rude as he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his surprise, Leifu immediately turned his head curiously: "First Secretary of State? Judicial Chairman? Is his two official positions very large?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiu Lan frowned: "Of course it is very big. If you want to make an analogy, it is equivalent to the position of the Prime Minister and the Supreme Judge... One of the highest politicians, second only to the speaker of the parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reeve stunned, it seems that there is still some reaction: "That is, he Is it a very important person in the Republic of the Ruble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet; Nitton intervened and explained: "Or, in other words, you have heard of it. Ruhrock’s second secretary of state, Nikolay; Machiavelli? This Mr. Brighton is his immediate supervisor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh!” To this explanation, Raf; Namlock suddenly realized, and looked at the man in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Chase, who has been listening to them, has been filled with anger in the eyes of Brighton, but it is not good for the occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily; Maggie didn’t take care of the attitude of the second most valuable person in the Republic of the Conrocian, and continued her own topic as if she were very convinced Like him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And our group is being chased by unknown forces and lost a lot of people - this is what everyone has witnessed. We can't believe those middle people And the French army, because they are all likely to be behind the scenes. The appearance of everyone has helped us a lot. I am grateful to you on behalf of the government of the Republic of the Republic of Ruhr. Our goal for the next stage is at 26 Before arriving at Lenny, I rushed to lobby before the resumption of the parliament on the 27th."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this date, the female pastor breathed a sigh of relief: "27? You don't have to be like this tonight. We can find a big town to enjoy the banquet of the Pentecost, I suggest adding this to the agenda."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily With a slight smile, it seems that Leifu will make this request: "This has been written into the itinerary. If everything is normal, we can buy a lively flamingo in the afternoon at the Baanwu Town Market, 65 kilometers south. Do you have any other questions?"<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Ninka raised her hand: "Hey... I have a problem that is not quite right, Miss Margaret, can you ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as it is about the task, please speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... how is the room allocated tonight?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this question, Lily; Maggie also stunned - this is indeed a problem beyond her expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renee took a bite on her lips and braved her courage: "That, can I have that alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this request, the green-haired woman Close your eyes and think about it. "I won't have much problems here. So, Miss Namlock, what about us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words haven't finished yet, Lei Fu; Namlock jumped up from his chair and threw himself into the bed. He grasped the shoulders of Yanika with both hands and looked at the brown-haired girl with a pleading look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ronica, can you think about it?" She whispered to the face of Yanika, "I don't want to be with that nasty indifference woman." Stay together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 has shrunk backwards: "But, I don't sleep well, I still snoring, grinding my teeth, talking about my dreams..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard these unheard of things, the female pastor who came from the wealthy family had frowned and fought fiercely in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... then it’s just like this. At night, sleep alone, do you learn that you haven’t learned magic in this area?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I can solve it." Yanika apologized apologetically to avoid the concern of the female pastor. In fact, she doesn't fight or grind her teeth; she just doesn't want others to hear the dreams she might say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paladin stood at the window of the hotel and looked out. Through the thin white cotton shirt, there are many scars on his arms and chest muscles. For many years of habit, only before going to bed, Xiu Lan will not wear armor like this; after all, what he is doing is a business that may be life-threatening at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three o'clock, are you still not sleeping?" Jeter, who was already lying in bed, asked Nyton yawning, "I don't pay attention to health when I was young." I will regret it at my age."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan could not help but laugh. "Uncle, are you only forty? Don't know if I can live to that age... I just think about this task today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet The tone is condensed: "Because it is the relationship of the task that Kengler came from? Are you worried?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly worried. This escort mission is dangerous. But there are opportunities... I am thinking about how to do the best. In short, we must first determine the identity of the pursuer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is an empire, it will be troublesome. The infiltrators of the Arbitration Association have quite dangerous detection magic and may not be safe here. But if not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jet picks up his words Head: "So it will be very dangerous in Lenny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, let’s wait for these two days." Xiulan stood up, " I went to Pike and asked him to develop a defense plan. This work may be very important and can't be lazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I Sleep for ...... "middle-aged priest punched a big yawn, rolled over. Xiulan quietly blows out the oil lamp and walks out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he went out, he noticed a slight shiny wire on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't step on." Pike; Tap's voice didn't know where the shadow came from. "Not good yet."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiu Lan was a little surprised and looked at the wire and asked: "How are you so diligent today? Are you not very disdainful of these traps?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the shadow snarled and replied: "Today lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it because today's The results have been surpassed by others. Do you want to use this kind of thing to show your true strength?" Xiu Lan suddenly remembered the resume of this silent young man, and some of them were crying and laughing. "There is no such need. Except you, it will not be here. Some people use the number of killers to determine the pros and cons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to the Cavaliers is a gentle cold, it seems to contain a kind of "disdaint" mood. Upon hearing this response, Xiu Lan suddenly felt a nameless fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing these words, after a long while, Parker; Tapu replied in a still calm tone: "Is your value system different from me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The tone of the sentence sounds like a statement, but it is undoubtedly a rhetorical question. Shulan was like a big hammer hitting the front, stepping back and almost stepping on the wire. The unpleasant conversation between the two people was interrupted, and they each quietly returned to the room and never mentioned this matter again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But both Jeter and Yanika have heard the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genius girl magician bites the edge of the pillow and burys the head in the pillow - but this does not stop those through the door and cotton. Sporadic vocabulary that floats into your ears. Renee had no intention of listening carefully to what they said. She only needed to know that it was enough to be related to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be enough to make her heart confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows she is already a murderer. - Perhaps, still a good one, at least her companions said that. She completed the work that an adventurer should do, and also received praise from her companions...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but, why can't she feel a little happiness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these behaviors remind her of her past? Or, remind her of... her father who doesn't have human feelings? It seems that it is not right. Perhaps like the word they said, the "value system"? Her value system is different from their adventurers...? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, but she has already embarked on this path and can’t go back. There is no life like the past. It’s like those flame arrows, it’s impossible to take it out...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 turned around irritably, facing the ceiling. The conversation outside is getting smaller, leaving only the silence in the middle of the night. She handed a flame arrow at the wall, leaving only a small burning spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like magical technology. Once a person has ever realized a stronger skill, he can never retreat to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recalls the mood in the afternoon. Under the alternation of triumph and self-respect... her will and her faith are concentrated. At that time... she strongly hoped that she could defeat even one enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood. The feeling that you want to become stronger, want to win, and want strength. Focus on your fingertips to launch this magic. The realm she reached inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"only belongs to me...flame arrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is 黛Nika; Wei Lun, also known as Yanika; Lopez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she didn't want to admit it, she did inherit Crad; Lopez's genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new and fast flame arrow touches the ceiling and turns into a huge, strange dark spot. For a moment she felt a little off force, and her hands fell softly on the pillow. The demon passed over her eyelids and whispered in her ear, letting her forget the troublesome things and rest in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps this is the so-called 'super-magic' skill in the classics..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last moment before she went to sleep, she thought so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night nothing - maybe one night is not appropriate, because this night is only maintained until 6 am. Lily, who is also bloodshot in her eyes; Maggie woke up the adventurers and forced the team to join forces despite their protests. No one noticed that either the detection of magic or the wire trap did not play any role in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, there are some changes to the plan, we are afraid there is no Pentecost dinner. We are going to Lenny tonight."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who are sleepy have not responded for a while. But when they reacted, everyone in the room widened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reflective station got up was the "first Secretary of State Secretary". But he just stood up and took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
