			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 6th, 1666 (mday+127) Jena<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮The card didn't sleep all night. She also determined that she could not fall asleep again. She simply started the morning meditation and magic exercise, and even took a shower like Missy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood in the eyes is too much to overflow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had to adjust the twilight with a little magic to make herself look less tired. After she had done everything, she was lying in bed boring, waiting for the maid to send the news that she must arrive to her own camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some things really don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main army is in the process of advancing Was severely intercepted and unable to move forward. Sid Naser is about to arrive and take over all the wars on the far left. The far left-wing troops will be reorganized with the Superintendent's brigade that has arrived overnight, and launch a full-scale offensive today, so that the enemies of Jena and Blenheim will not have a chance to merge. Even the main lord of the Duke of Fegota may move to the far left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every piece is enough to keep her insomnia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, it is impossible for Jenica to know in advance the decision made by the main army headquarters. The emergency messenger system controlled by the Ministry of Security has always been known for its confidentiality, and this time the force transfer order is the highest level of confidentiality for both the enemy and the friendly. The Legion headquarters calculated that the Free Army sent a hidden ace magician, the purpose is to ensure that the South Line defense is safe and sound, they will not think that the emperor will build a defensive offensive in the far left wing in this embarrassing situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she just knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, Maggie ya? Veri’s avatar staying around her suddenly became active and even allowed her to see Sid’s sight directly. The usual magical efficiency can't do this. She humbly asks the great spiritual master for advice, but Maggie seems to have little understanding of the mystery: "Perhaps the efforts of the Free Army to destroy the squad have improved the efficiency of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, the Freedom Army interferes with the magical blessings, as long as she is willing, she knows as much as the Security Minister Sid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, she knows that in the past day, the headquarters has damaged nearly 300 officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the attack of the mysterious witch, all the surviving officers have removed their ranks, but this will not improve the efficiency of the command. The command system that barely recovered did not bring any good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of rebuilding roads is extremely slow, and accidents occur from time to time during the reconstruction process. The truncated is not only the main road of the north, but also the three auxiliary roads that are paralleled. One of the rivers was destroyed most fiercely, the dam collapsed, and the flood rushed into the roads on both sides of the river, turning the gravel road into a muddy road. Although the losses on the remaining three roads are not large, the roads are not allowed to pass by the carriages and the brakes. The dangerous mystery of the magical girl is still stalking nearby, unable to confirm its whereabouts, but from time to time there are several companies that have been reported to be completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the staff gathered together, bowed their heads and repeated "please ask the Duke to order to stop the attack", the result can only be more angered by the fergota's king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yenica just called Maggie to open the visual sharing and completely witnessed the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The 35,000-strong imperial army, even because of the deterrence of a female magician, stopped moving forward! How many people and how many troops are you even in the enemy? Unclear! One person? Can one block the entire attack positive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Military Affairs, Loren von Figueta, will strengthen the mahogany in the headquarters The table was made up of two swords and cursed loudly. Despite his age, the Duke’s skill in using swords is still proficient. The Minister of Military Affairs has accumulated a lot of power over the years, and no one dares to face upright - except for "someone." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid Nasse’s left hand insignificantly draws an invisible symbol on a stack of reports, and then picks up the words: "From the witness analysis, it is possible She is either a twin or a fifth child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put all the elite troops and attack the enemy heavy group of Jena and Blenheim from the far left. Once the battle shows signs of failure, give up all the troops on the far left and retreat the rest to Lenny as the last. Sid’s tone is very calm. “In the intelligence work, we call this cut. I know that you will have opinions, so the far left troops will be directed by me, with the military as the core. If it is irreparable, You just don't have to worry about me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone wants to ease the atmosphere: "How can that be, you are a great minister, you can't be in danger." "And the road to the far left is not wide, and it is possible to transport two brigades after a full day of play. This is too dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the main legion all fifteen brigades I am afraid that I will be able to get it for a week. This simple arithmetic can not be settled even with the military affairs of the Nika, which means that the far left is just a lonely army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid did not appreciate the right hand and interrupted these people: "No, I am psychologically prepared for the price. A real army is only There is one person left, and it can be rebuilt again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His right hand sleeve is empty. No one wants to continue discussing the issue of cost with him, including the old Duke of Figota. The matter was settled: the Superintendent’s brigade chased the Seventh Brigade and the Fegota Brigade in the far left, and launched an offensive on the morning of the 6th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is August 6. Although the security minister’s troops did not have precise timing, he himself would be very punctual--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Seneca, Good Morning. From the South, the investigative cavalry with a letter of letter, claiming to be the governor of the brigade, ask us to guide them to camp. The area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a little different from the expected? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 sits up and grabs the uniform from the maid’s hand and puts it on himself: “I didn’t go to the seventh brigade responsible for the avant-garde, but came to us. Here... Lord Sid’s idea is really interesting. Let’s go and inform the Governor of the Superintendent to get up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next door. As Sid’s actions emphasize, this brigade is different: the Figota brigade is so important that the superintendent is personally appointed by the first princess of Olia Hugh Coleman. Of course, she and Yanika know that in fact, this position only means that the two men are involved, and the war cabinet of the Majesty can accept it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived, the silver dragon Mara, who was sleeping on the foreign account, was fighting in human form. The buzz is not that big. It is a very pretty lady with a little sexy teasing, but it is very dangerous: the uncontrolled silver dragon flame is about the size of an arm, and it keeps squirting. The maid guard seems to have gotten used to it. She took a sneak peek at the angle that she wouldn't be affected, and touched Olivia's account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...So, Sid will be here in an hour. Do you have any thoughts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oliah stretched her hands indifferently, letting a few maids around me put on their uniforms, and at first glance, they lived a life of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else can it be? Since Sid is here, the battle must be directed by him. The governor team does not have to worry about this. He is me. The nominal boss, but will not issue orders through me. But are you ready? Sid is likely to mobilize your army this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Seneca sighed: "I'm afraid there is no choice. He came so fast, or the night road, there must be no artillery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Military things I I don't understand. If the team is fighting, I still know a little. If you don't want to lose too much, just remember that the 'Fegota army can only be transferred by the Figota family.'" Olia smiled. "I can understand." The ideas of the nobility, no one wants to see their troops lose too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, I said how my few cheap brothers are so active. People give me.” Yanika turned to several maids around. “You still have the things to change and you will rebuild the Figota army. Heavy duty? Just, the recent training results don’t seem very good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several maids condense their faces, while squinting at one knee, one knee: "Sorry, let you down. We will prove ourselves on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will fight for the family and Missy to the last moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonyka shrugged and accepted this pledge of allegiance, pulling Olia out Go to the door. Mara, who is on the outside account, has woken up and is licking the open space at the door. When I saw Yinlong, I had a sudden idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Olia, let's surprise Sid? I have to go back and change clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then, when Sid Nath took the commander's sword of the Major General Brigade with his left hand at the Seventh Brigade, Silver Dragon dive and landed beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of people, it is thick and bright purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first girl who jumped from the silver dragon, dressed in a lilac maiden dress, decorated with golden tassels, is gorgeous. The purple enamel coat is adorned in the front chest, and the cloak is unfolded backwards. The wind is hunted in the wind brought by the dragon wings, stunning the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is... the big dress of the Figota family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not seen this The soldiers in formal costumes whispered. Since the first public wars in the South have changed a lot of flags, since then the families have not used their exclusive color uniforms for the Emperor’s service, and replaced them with family-colored badges and armbands. And chest identification chapter. Only when fighting in their own territory or holding a nobility meeting will the public appear in their own colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Purple 苜蓿'. Purple is the main color, green is the rim, ending the color of the elf empire."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of gesture is so powerful that people can't help but start to re-evaluate the Fegota family's emphasis on the foster daughter. What's more, she still took the silver dragon with Princess Olia...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The left-wing defender of the Imperial Main Forces, the commander of the Fegota Special Brigade Nika Vilen von Figota will report to you, Deputy Commander. I am willing to use my magic artillery to provide unreserved and full support in the offense."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinika said the long-prepared lines and expressed what he meant. With the strength of the Fygueta Brigade and her position here, she was not qualified to make such a request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is claimed to be a brigade, there are only about three battalions with no more than 1,500 troops. The basic unit of warfare of the emperor is the battalion. The original meaning of this word is "a square matrix." In wartime, these battalions will be compiled into brigades according to strategic needs, and the Freedom Army is quite different from the basic strategic unit with independent divisions. The main army has sixteen brigades, but there are mixed special forces such as the Fegeta brigade that have been compiled for political reasons. This political expression is also the cost of her statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why a person is very powerful is often because he or she looks very powerful. Sid understands this, and Janica understands this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relationship is equal. If you need my cooperation, the relationship must be an equal ally. I will give you my artillery, but I will never allow you to command the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Princess, you have become more beautiful recently. Oh, of course, the Princess His Royal is also more beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sid smiled and extended his left hand to Renee. He is wearing a governor's gown that is also rarely used. The pure black background and the red secondary color constitute the atmosphere of Xiao Xiao. The official seal of the Royal Security Department (rsa) consisting of a golden sword, a silver scorpion shield and a red diagonal cross is also prominently hung on the chest. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninica did not hurry to shake hands, but asked the question she already knew the answer: "Have your right hand been injured?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, a little hurt, don't mind." Sid lifted his right hand and waved if nothing happened. "Even if you use healing magic to temporarily recreate your limbs, you can't exercise spells. So I asked someone to do an emergency treatment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people were stunned, including the sika who had seen Sid’s empty sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of Security’s sleeves are not empty, but there are no hands there-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renee took a half step back and almost fell; Olia simply fell on her legs and fell directly into the arms of the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is Sid, the most horrible courtier of the emperor wants to see something else, can make other people's minds gap. Yanika hesitated and took the initiative to extend her right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it’s just a little injury, should I think it should not affect traditional etiquette?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She can hear the sound of the people around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid in the eyes of Sid-Nasser. He reached out his right arm and put the black gems at the front of the staff into the palm of his hand. Renee did not want to fall in front of him and held the black jewel in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately felt the coldness of the bones, as if there were endless negative feelings contained in the gems, could not help but close my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear, malice, death, greed climb up the blood vessels, nerves, and magic circuits of the arm, just as there are countless ants crawling up in their bodies. But I don't know why I feel very comfortable - there is a wonderful pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is a voice in her ear that says "Stabilize!", sounds like Maggie. According to the previous agreement, as the soul, it should not be risky to contact her in person...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yenica woke up from the comfort and was alert to it. The hidden danger, violently took a deep breath and released all the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head and commented: "A very interesting staff. Are you going to break the enemy line with the magic attached to this stick today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so, thank you for the compliment. Just ask for two..." Sid looked at the silver dragon that changed back to the human form. "No, the three ladies' artillery guide us. Victory. The Warlord Brigade begins to prepare for the attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers of the Superintendent Brigade made a low cry, neatly like a person. Renee took the excuse of returning to command the artillery and fled the ally that made her nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to her own army, she stood at the top of a watchtower and watched the changing situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the four lenses of the high-powered telescope, Jena’s perimeter defenses are boring. Compared to Lenny, who grew up from her childhood, this is not a big city. The former wine trade center, now composed of military camps, has become a military camp, will become a military camp, a house that once became a military camp, and a wall used to protect these houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black military uniform of the superintendent team and the gray military uniform of the emperor are mixed together and marching toward those defense lines. The sound of the guns rumbling, and the enemy’s firepower began to counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the first and second rounds of each other's temptations, the fire points of both sides were exposed. Renee showed two-thirds of the firepower and finally gained an advantage in the artillery battle. Several of the fortifications of the Free Army against the wall were silent, and only the side and the artillery continued to fire. Some firepower points seem to be shifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortifications are very simple: a gentle slope, a deep trench for one person, a counter-artillery wall deep in a trench, a cement chest wall with a steep slope and a steep slope. There is a line of infantry behind the wall and the chest wall. Compared to the bastion to the horrible design, all the bombardment of the impact point can cause a considerable level of casualties to the defenders. Most of Bruchelle’s maid artillery had read ballistics, and their shells exploded in the enemy’s infantry and artillery, turning the free soldiers who had fought and fighting into bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the results of the first two attacks are really shocking. The wreckage is covered with every attack point, and each corner of the ditch is filled with hundreds of corpses on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipal can count more than one officer commando, these casters bravely attack the enemy's bombs, their magic cut off the enemy's moat. Even so, these attacks did not change the outcome of the failure, but only made the sacrifice more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia has been a bit out of sight: "We still have artillery, 黛妮卡? Why not?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said yes." The first princess of the empire looked at the battlefield and said, "It’s just such ugly things... those gray mounds that arbitrarily traversed the fields, a sense of beauty, seven twists and turns The ditch is like the mucus left after the gray slime climbs over. Is this kind of thing, why is it impossible to break it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jena is not Tilburg is not Lenny. Jena's retaining wall has only the simplest brick walls, plus the watchtower, and even the fort is a dirt hill that is temporarily piled up, and everything depends on the simple trench. However, Steelburg was taken by a surprise attack. Lenny's five-fold high wall has been dug up to the present, and Jena stands in front of the best army of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your description is really mean, my Royal Highness." Yanika walked to the military map, and the enemy’s invincible enemy’s trench line was explained. "That is Vobang, the simplest and most effective fortification in the world. A qualified army can be built in one day. Its power does not come from traps or bunkers, but from the defenders."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jena was debuted on the battlefield for the first time on August 4, and two days on the 6th was enough for the defenders here to build the city into a fortress. Renee only remembers that Clade often complained about the inefficient construction of the engineering, but did not expect the efficiency of the Free Army during the war to become extremely high. She wondered: If I expected it early, I should take a little more to attack the ammunition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vauban...the name is so familiar," Olily slaps her head and thinks, "is Presler? Vauban (prestrelevauban ) Admiral? Commander of the Imperial City Defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he now the commander of the Imperial City Defense?" This fact made Denika a little surprised, she knows Vauban It was through her biological father, "When he was young, he played for the French army, and he invented this kind of ridiculous fortification with the Fregota repeatedly. However, any force with a firm battle will build up the Vauban. Can resist the enemy's attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we let such a trench stop the way forward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the problem with Olivia, I was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a new attack began, and this time Sid personally led the troops and chose a new breakthrough point. More killings, more deaths, more Vauban 被 washed by blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Renee answered honestly. "I don't understand military. But as long as I am willing to pay a high enough price, any fortification can be Breakthrough. I don't know how much it costs, but the commanders must know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess grumbled and scratched his head: "Your words sound a bit contradictory. So, can we break through this line of defense today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is actually not a contradiction." She recalled what she got when she asked her father the same question. The answer, "There is no law in war. War is just like a life, just a gamble. Ah, Sid hit a purple signal bullet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No 黛妮卡To issue orders, repressive shelling followed the footsteps of the Security Minister. Sid's magic cleaned up a company's Free Army, and three or five mid-level magicians used force field magic to build an invisible bridge on a trench that was destroyed by shelling on the opposite chest wall. The assault troops shouted a meaningless slogan, rushed past Vobang, and approached the wall of Jena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olia began to feel nervous, her heel unconsciously turned on the ground: "This is going to be **, right, Jenny. Card?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify the Third Artillery Corps to prepare." Yanika felt a little uneasy and realized that she was in some kind of conspiracy, "Let the first The first and second artillery units arranged for defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as in response to her judgment, the music played. It is a majestic organ sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Army’s artillery positions are burning, the gunpowder is also exploding, and the trenches are broken. However, the music has already rang, and it is a song that has been mixed with the feelings of marching and hymns and has never been heard. As the music progressed, the magical energy was gathered in nothingness, the notes and the lines flowed together in the air, and then fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These meteors made of music, half shot at the gunner position of Jenica, and the other half bombarded the center of the breakthrough force in Sid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
