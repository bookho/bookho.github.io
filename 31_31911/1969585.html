			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A philosopher once said that you can divide the world into two innumerable ways. For example, there are only two people in the world: "I have seen this novel", and "I am about to see this novel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method still applies here. People generally divide them into two kinds: they are spiritual, and they don't have the spirit - they can also call it the will, the soul, or something similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature that can drive magic in its own spirit is a smart creature; a creature that cannot use magic is a common creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, the spirit determines the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a problem: What if the powerful spirit does not want to disappear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't want to die." "I want to live." "I still have important things to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world gives a less than perfect answer - that is undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the dust and the soil, relying on the will to exist in the world, the "biological" that has died but is still alive. Ever since the wisdom creatures discovered the magic, the nightmare of undead has been entangled in them. That is a terrible temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you pay for it, you can live in another form, are you willing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People know that there are still some powerful undead creatures that have re-entered the civilized world and have been recognized by people in various identities - for example, "that person"; people also know that being undead will be met by the whole world. Hunting and killing will be overwhelmed by the pastors, but they can have different strengths and long lives. If it is you, how would you choose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you pay a sufficient price and have a desire to die, you may become an undead. The more fragile the spirit, the greater the price to pay; the stronger the obsession, the less the price to pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only nameless deceased who left the idea of ​​"want to live" became a jealousy and a zombie. People who only want to live, after turning into undead, can only wander aimlessly or obey the orders of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obsessively overwhelming deceased will give up **, leaving only his own will, becoming a ghost or shadow. The perpetrators are permanently in the spiritual world or in the film world, and suffer eternal torture for their obsession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who has a strong spirit but who died because of an accident will become a ghoul or a war corpse if he is awakened from the other world. The unsuccessful people still retain memories and experiences and become the sharp edge in the hands of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the great and brave, able to give up life, can become the most powerful undead. The mummy who gave up life, the vampire who gave up the sun, and the lich who gave up the **. They are also the most powerful undead creatures known to the seventeenth century. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a lich, powerful magic is the most basic premise. After that, he had endless time to do magic research. Therefore, each lich has great confidence in his abilities, and they also have enough money to support that confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this does not mean that the Lich is a Wufu who has no mind and is reckless. The most important thing for the lich is the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of tension in the small chamber. An unknown number of shadows haunted between the shadows of the swaying, attacking every human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Weapons...Weapons..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little "elf archers" most First attacked. The black shadows wrap around his neck and body, and he looks like he will be smashed at any time: they all see it, this thin and dry object is the most easily destroyed object of all. He felt a little desperately touching his waist and remembered that he had not brought any weapons in. The power kept flowing from him and entered into those shadow-like resentments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who...who will help me!" The man turned his eyes for help, and he was probably not a magic user. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull; Major Tedwood raised his right hand, and the index finger and the middle finger were together, aiming at the numerous shadows around the man. He minimized the singing time of the gathering magic, only to repel the shadows of the "God of Justice" as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...searing beam!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other standing next to it A god of war also shot at the same time. After crossing the emblem on the chest, the head of the right index finger of "Core" gathered white light. Unlike Hull, the technique he used turned out to be a magical technique - and, obviously, it was a Orthodox school. This made Hull slightly surprised: the identity of the soldier is almost ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow of the flame, and the blazing white light hit the shadow of the little man almost simultaneously. The two shadows disappeared in an instant, and the rest hurriedly re-entered the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not bad." The two gods looked at each other with a arrogant look - unfortunately the call of a small man who was hit by two magic at the same time Broke their sorrow and cherish. The "elf archers" were extremely disrespectful, and even rolled up the table and ran towards them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Northerners?" Hull tempted to ask the soldiers around him, "I am a free army, I hope we can trust each other now."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not exactly." Another "Corell" replied, "I am a 'pioneer' and we should count as an alliance."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major raised his eyebrows when he heard the name. "Harbingers," or "pioneers," are radical activists who want to overthrow the emperor's regime in the north and establish a free republic like the South. The Pioneer Party has a huge force in the entire civilized world, and there are countless sympathizers - of course, the aristocrats of the northern government are regarded as the nails in the eyes and the thorns in the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you be too reckless to say this? There are people in the Royal Security Department who are allowed to be there..." The Queen kindly reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter. After such a big trouble tonight, this identity must be abandoned." The man said, "Even if it is the Royal Security Department, Now we have to cooperate... Are you right? 'Mr. Lesardo'?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...?" Hearing his words, the little man The sound trembled fiercely. "You, you are right. We are going to help each other now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between these people is really complicated, Hull thought. It is estimated that the Royal Security Agent will also change his place of work in the future...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just thinking of it, he only feels a cold leg - power immediately from there Let it go. The shadows are surrounded again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼...!" The pioneering party also snorted and was estimated to have been attacked. "...In the name of the Holy Covenant, let go, the undead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows were only a moment of stagnation and did not disappear with his dispersal. It seems that the level of the "Churell" is at most the pastor or parish priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awful... Can't kill it?...burhands (burning hands)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The major concentrated the magical flame on the palm of his hand, like a mosquito, constantly driving the shadow of his body. He asked for a look at his chief's direction - but was shocked by the scene there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad; Lopez is doing his best to resist the lich's tidal offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of five humans. A seemingly strong guy, a slightly tricky priest, two can be ignored, and one is unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s an average person, you’ll choose to pick up the weak first. But for the lich who is ready to fight quickly, his choice can only be to attack the strong first. As long as you defeat the strongest, the rest will be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strongest person in the field is obviously the man who wields the mysterious blue light weapon. After making up his mind, the Lich poured all his magic into Clade; Lopez's direction. For the Lich, every part of the body is a weapon that has been prepared for a long time - the small problem of the body, as long as you find another dead person, there will be a new one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unsurprisingly... broken dreams!" After seeing the bones before him, Clade estimated the attack. The blue light flashed and the bone spear was cut into powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job." The lich appreciated with a hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Oriental proverb says that passive acceptance of light and not giving back to others is not in line with 'ritual'." Klad’s thoughts, a few blue lights Go straight and go straight to the giant body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you...blood rain (blood rain)!" The sneer sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pierced wound on Juhan blasted openly; every drop of blood instantly became a bullet for attack. With a strong corrosive blood drop, like a tidal wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the situation is not good, the generals recovered the "broken dreams", squatting down, left hand on the ground: "...stone wall!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor was opened, and a stone wall from where I did not know suddenly appeared in the middle of the room, dividing the room into two halves. The lich was originally sneering, and the sneer was slammed by the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the blood and rain hit the stone wall, causing a "clam" of corrosion - this sound made everyone shocked. Stone walls are still the same, what if you hit someone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the stone wall to temporarily block the opponent's attack, Clade; Lopez finally had a chance to breathe. With this opportunity, he quickly put away the broken dreams - the flying sword has begun to tremble slightly, which is caused by continuous use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustment...Right rate adjustment. Let the truth spread throughout the body... Before the lich breaks through the wall, let yourself return to the best state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Great Wasteland, I have not seen the Lich... Why is it in this place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Undead Legion of the Great Wilderness...Ladz; Govar's rebellion and behind-the-scenes black hands... The mysterious lich appearing at the intelligence agency exchange meeting...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should it be connected? If all this is part of a big conspiracy... Thinking about this dangerous problem, he feels his blood is getting hotter and his heartbeat is getting faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it nervous? This is not normal... wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad; Lopez’s face has really changed. He knew that he was still fooled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Blood??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone spear, blood rain, are for Take his attention away from himself - this blood burst, which was planted before the Lich launched the bone spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic can kill people without a whole body, even the resurrection can not do, can be called the first-class dangerous demons; more sinister is, in There will be almost no signs before the subject bursts and will not be detected by the detected magic. The sooner the subject is discovered, the easier it is to resist this magic: once the heartbeat and blood temperature begin to increase, it is basically unhelpful. The first victim should have been in this magic, and then struggling to open the secret door to ask for help...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradd regrets his own intentions and rushes to concentrate Fight against the rapid heartbeat caused by blood blasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, you still underestimate me, the lich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is able to adjust his own Breathing - this is the skill he learned in the East. The average person should have bleed and died now, but he will not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he is given three minutes, he can suppress this magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good fierce attack and defense..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being busy with the shadows Hull of low-level creatures can't help but be self-defeating. He knew that General Lopez had done a great job in magic, but he didn't know that he could already compete with the Lich but didn't fall. He also found another point: I have to wait for many years to rise to the lieutenant... He could not see the existence of the blast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...holy shield." Female voice with a slight sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a white sacred aperture enveloped the body of the major. The few shadows touched this aperture and disappeared in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same magic, used in the hands of different people, the result is completely different. Even if it is just an ordinary holy shield, if the operator is strong enough, it can repel the shadows - even the lich. He turned his head and found that the other two were covered in the same aperture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...is it really a Protestant pastor?" The pioneer asked in disbelief. Every Orthodox pastor believes that Protestantism is an organization that has no real skills and only relies on inciting the masses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, barely count it." The enchanting woman who saved them sighed sly... No, it’s no longer glamorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her body, a sacred and inviolable breath is emanating - just like the enchanting front is just a layer of her shell. Hull; Tedwood never thought that a person could have such a big change. He felt like something was falling in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I ask your name?" I don't know why, a sudden impulse made him pull the woman and said something abrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t seem to think that he would say this, paused: "Do you ask the target directly, can you count as an intelligence officer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, will you have the opportunity to receive the task of infiltrating the Free Army? I am very happy to cooperate." The major ghost said something frivolous - he did not know why . Since birth, he has always been a serious and serious person, even in love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before that, you have to be the target that is worthy of others' penetration with 'very good means'? Major." "Furilla" uses the same frivolous tone Reply. Hearing the last word, Hull; Tedwood twitched a bit - certainly not able to escape her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guess it." Her mask seemed to smile with a good smile. "But now I don't have time to talk to you... your chief is in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the danger?" the major asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at him with a slight contempt, as if he thought he should know the same. The woman prepared a healing magic in her hand, and white light gathered on her left hand. Her delicate little chin was exposed outside the mask, and it was shaking in rhythm, as if counting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five, four, three, two, one...coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her voice Just falling, the stone wall collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich’s figure flashed and ran straight along the collapsed stone wall to Krad; Lopez. Those who are concentrating on blood blasting are unlikely to have the power to manipulate such powerful magical devices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone spear is a cover. Blood rain is also a cover. As for this blasting, it is actually a cover. The Lich did not underestimate his opponent. He was not naive enough to believe that he could win by blasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All preparations are for this last real attack. An attack that brings death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...deathh (touch of death)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black radiance flashes in witch The left hand of the demon. This is the one that must win and kill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can mobilize the will at the same time against two mortal magic. The blood that bursts out after the death of this person will destroy everyone else...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Lich plans to take the next step, someone gently Patted his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you disturb? Slightly counter it....heal (complete treatment)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;For undead, damage magic is healing; in contrast, healing magic is death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible...! How can I be countered...!" The scream screamed, and the body trembled and groaned in the white light. He does not believe... his most proud magic, the touch of death will be countered by a pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The undead intelligence network has never pointed out that there are such powerful pastors in this city...!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last thought of the Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your only mistake is not to ignore the idlers, etc." "Goddess of Destiny" gently and elegantly kicked him with a high heel tip, " Dust back to the dust, earth to earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of the lich and undead kings tried to maintain the balance and collapsed instantly. Fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Clade; Lopez pressed the bloody blast and raised his head. He saw everything just now, and this thank you really came from the heart. "Your counter-magic is really strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're welcome. It's a pastor's job to knock down undead." "Furilla" re- The candle in the room was lit and the room was re-lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hull came forward and shouted loudly: "Since we have to change our defenses right away, is it better to pass each other's history?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Curry!" Claud whispered to hear such a nondescript suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman "snapped" and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just want to know my name and contact information? It’s not so good to be a spy, it’s not good to end. If you forget, let me know. I Yes..." She paused here. "The vampire killer can only come out at night, Bartholomew; only (bruce wayne)."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Only at night...? Are you also a vampire?" asked the major. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... it’s a half vampire." She then turned into a bat. "All half vampires, hate undead. In the daytime, you I can't see Barthes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The illusion, did you do it?" Hull had a question to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman turns her body back into humanity: "Yeah. Is this trick not bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It coincides." Hull replied with a smile - half a moment he remembered that the other party should not see his smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the guards of the Thieves Guild kicked the door and rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We got an alert! What's the matter here... Wait a minute, the watcher is dead?! Who did it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five humans in the house laughed together as a response to this group of guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two who were not in the mood to do the intelligence transaction soon resigned and left in a small boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The harvest tonight is not small." On the way back to the station, Clade concluded, "At least, we know Radz; Govar has The possibility of rebellion. This requires further investigation and surveillance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah." The major snorted and didn't know if he heard it or didn't hear it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other is the mysterious lich, which deserves further investigation. The two Royal Security Department and the Pioneer Party guys must change their residence, so don't mention it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman who can counter the Lich magic, is What is the head? You should also pay attention to this by the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
