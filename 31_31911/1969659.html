			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayday, June 6, 1667, mday+66 Kengal City West; Stillburg Military Camp<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emperor and his dragon fell into the rear camp of the Steelburg Army. The commander of the emperor decisively made a decision--or arrogantly-initiated a counterattack. The attack was fierce and effective, and the frontal Freedom Army consumed more than half of the magical power. The soldiers were also defeated by the frontline. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in addition to more than a thousand soldiers killed, injured or missing and more than 3,000 soldiers who lost their command or retreat, the Free Army is There are about 20,000 organized personnel on the front line, and the opposite emperor has 11,000 people from the Kengal Legion and 14,000 from the Royal Guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Steelburg Army is a temporary establishment and is currently being commanded by Colonel Luther. It administers the entire division of the first division plus a division of the sixth and twelfth divisions, the entire "war" militia division and a number of local garrisons of approximately 38,000 combatants, with total force occupying the entire Free Army. One quarter. The South detachment sent to Kengal took up half of it, which is 19,000. The number of Western Army General Reserves coming from the South Line is much smaller, and the combatants are only 7,000. By simple subtraction, it can be inferred that there are at most 3,000 soldiers in the camp of the Fort Stilt, less than one tenth of the preparation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course The camp is not an empty camp. To meet the logistics of a modern army, it is not enough to rely on the regular army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the preservation of the heavy camp, the Steelburg Army left not only two thousand regular troops, but also 8,000 militiamen responsible for logistics and one More than 10,000 non-combatants - including family members, laborers, coolies, businessmen, hawkers, mercenaries, jugglers, slaves and even prostitutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire camp is still bustling, even more lively than usual, because everyone is very concerned about the outcome of the battle. Once the Free Army is defeated, this camp will become the spoils of the imperial nobles. Merchants who invest in the Free Army will lose their money, and if they are unable to receive the money, they will be robbed, and the women will break into the enemy. The timidity has begun to plan to escape, and the daring is to consider the time to mix into the emperor to make money. The soldiers tried their best to maintain order, but they were no longer as hard as they were when they were stationed in the past few days. Once the army was defeated, it was impossible to stop the emperor's pursuit by the two thousand regular troops here. They will burn most of the materials according to the order, and then retreat to the place where the defense can be organized to rebuild the defense line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there will be no one in the camp to prepare for the silver dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly capable magicians were transferred to the front line, and the rest were only waiting to be slaughtered in front of the emperor. The fierce air battle in the distance destroyed people's last resistance. When the silver beast rushed into the camp, everyone screamed and fled, and the password system that should have been rigorously became ineffective. Obviously, Luther, who lacked the experience of bringing troops, left his worst troops here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one female sergeant rushed against the crowd to the location of the fall. In the chaos, no one noticed her difference, and no one would know that she was the one who summoned the dragon to land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia; Hugh; Keman hurried past the camp that was riddled with holes in the artillery battles of the previous few days. Everyone only cares about the four escapes, no one pays attention to her comrades in uniform. Of course, the secrecy of the Liberation Army officers has also made great contributions here: there are few people who know that the imperial princess was captured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the fall?" She looked for traces of the silver dragon, "Malamanna Savia... Tell me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response came, she smiled and walked into a burning military uniform warehouse. Olivia recited a few prayers and waved her hand to vacuum to temporarily isolate the flame in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a dragon in front of her, but a woman with a tall figure and a shining silver glow. This does not surprise Oria: if she is, she will also choose a safe human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, why did you bring my dragon? The one I always wanted to summon you, always unsuccessful..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sentence is stuck in Olia's throat because she heard another voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard her voice. The same sound. Another Olia also wore a royal silver tight armor, accompanied by a silver dragon who should belong to the Queen. Although she could not see her face, she believed that even the looks were exactly the same. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is it?!" The other party heard her voice, but it didn't seem to sound the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you asking me?" Olivia crossed the flame and her tone became colder and colder. "I am the second heir to the Holy Coman Empire. A princess Olia; Hugh; Coman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she said the last person, her face was frozen, "that is, you, Nonica Miss Weilun.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other princess on the opposite side obviously had no mental preparation, and while warning around, he stammered and asked: "You are... Leah? How come you are here... Did you escape yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Now time is tight, return my identity and the dragon I. Mara, we take off immediately and leave here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliah; Hugh; Keman casually ordered to walk toward Silver Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait." Another Olia suddenly raised her hand and stopped in front of her. "Why did she suddenly land? Did you call her here, Olia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this bad tone, Olia Very uncomfortable to squat, but the invisible armor known as "high pride" quickly recovered. Her left hand pressed against her waist and seemed to hold an invisible weapon: "Are you asking me, Nika? I call my dragon to save me, is it necessary to explain it to you?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am asking you, yes. What are you thinking about? Do you know what you did? Do you know what the consequences will be?" The hand of the woman who took the silver dragon carefully stepped back two steps. She did not hold the dagger like the first princess of the real empire, but held down the silver burst pistol at the waist, and the left hand still clasped her scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliia looked at the familiar scepter. It exudes golden light, inlaid with gorgeous but imperfect jewels, and steel, platinum and gold form a harmonious harmony on this scepter. There is no doubt that it is a symbol of the coexistence of "force, glory and prosperity", the symbol of the imperial power...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Power." Even she has never used it. An inexplicable anger rushed into her mind and made her lose her usual manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did I do? I was captured, but did what I should do. Here is the enemy's hinterland, you should attack it directly. You How can you confront those people in a positive way? The dragon is not fighting like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 didn’t expect the other person to rebut her with a set of principles that are taken for granted. I got up: "Here? What's there? There is nothing but a broken battle. Here is their country. They can always add these weights! As for the staff, I am afraid that those guys will join the attack on me." "Stupid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just saw her father's signature magic, and also knows the input required for this size of interception. Judging from the creation of the Freedom Army's magic warfare, it is suspicious that there are no magicians in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it stupid? I don't know, I just think that morale will be higher." Olia quietly warned herself to be calm. Then say that the other party is just a girl, the mind can not be too deep...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is you who want to pay attention to your tone and movement. The real Princess will not With a mushy gun that is low-pitched and low-lying, who has heard of a puff-filled princess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the musket can kill a civilian Aristocrats? Your thoughts are really narrow.” Yanika sneered. “Do you know that you destroyed the last hope of this war? You think about it, why is it me, not your brother, will it be here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question asked Olia. "What is he doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He originally wanted to bring reinforcements to the Guards' team, but we spent a full five days and only sent them over. A brigade... There are only three thousand guards on the front line of Kegler! The other guards are at least fifty kilometers from here, and they are three days away!" The plan that she participated in the development became like this, 黛Nika's voice is getting bigger and bigger. "What we need is not morale, but resilience! The reason why I replaced your brother is to bluff, dragging the enemy troops here before the main force goes north... This is good, near The Guardian loyal guys who are bigger than the courage must launch a general assault! Destroyed, completely ruined! Without the 3,000 Guards, how can the remaining miscellaneous and aristocratic private soldiers hold it here!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think you deserve this responsibility, Olia? All you have done is to get your brother's army to be closer and closer! What you are doing is to escape and always escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I am escaping." The princess held out her index finger and pointed at another tip of her nose. "What about you? Why are you here for me?" Should you be responsible? Are you responsible? Are you not escaping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am for..." Seneca’s words were stalked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is she responsible for? Why is she playing a role that is not her own? At first it seemed to be just because of an angry anger with my father... now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like seeing her thoughts, the real princess said leisurely: "Now you can go back to your country, and I am in my own identity. Go back. This is good for both of us, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't understand. That's absolutely not, I have to go back. I refuse."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the brain's answer, I will regret it. She has discovered a dilemma and a solution that the other party can choose. Here, all responsibilities have the opportunity to shirk into the head of the free army... Then, even if the other party admits it will not be how? After all, one is a princess, the other is just...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 subconsciously took a step back. She shook her hand in a panic: "No, let me think about it again. It's not the time to discuss this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the Free Army outside did not give She will consider the time again. The loud command echoed over the camp, proving that they had recovered from the chaos. The sound of the release command seems a bit familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The total reserve team has surrounded the camp! Everyone in the camp is on standby, and the slayer who left the camp slays to shoot! The defenders prepare to throw the cannon and the air defense!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No? How many people have they withdrawn?" Renee said in amazement, "The reserve team has withdrawn, they Don't be afraid of being breached?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alia bites her teeth and is dissatisfied with the tone: "It sounds like we lost the best time to take off." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough. You two are just right, now is not the best time for debate." Mara, who had been silent, shook the cloak and made it coldly. The ruling: "His Royal Highness, please decide, what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is facing Seneca instead of real Oria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yinlong explained without any emotion: "According to our covenant with the Coman family, I should be loyal to the wife of the human emperor. The emperor is unmarried or widowed. In the case, I should follow the instructions of the emperor to loyal to a particular woman. The order I am receiving now is loyal to the lady, which has nothing to do with her identity. Sorry, Your Highness Olia, I am going to listen to this now. His Royal Highness, she would not have to guard her to leave if she did not want to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this sentence, Oliya, who was still very relaxed, subconsciously retired A step back. The real princess stared blankly at the silver dragon, his lips trembled, and the history of the Coleman family kept slipping through his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is known for its neutrality in the history of the Empire. In the era of the Elven Empire, the royal family, the governors of the provinces, the Supreme Council, and even the powerful families all made their own contracts with the dragon. As a result, in the Dandelion War, these behemoths almost destroyed all the forces in the hands of the elves, and the forty-seven regiments only survived after the war. Nine, have been unable to suppress the human uprising. The first emperor Arthur; Keman learned the lessons of the elves, for the sake of the stability of the imperial power, the dragon's authority was strictly limited to the emperor's hands, all the power to negotiate with the dragon came from the emperor, even the emperor's use of the dragon's power came from the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This creates another result - the dragon does not interfere with the conspiracy inside the court. Under the deterrent of the dragon, there were few official wars between the emperor and the princes in the history of the empire, but there were countless assassinations and prisons. The heads of the princes, nobles and illegitimate children can be piled up into a hill. The female statues in the court are simply the former princesses. Olivia knows that as long as Jenny is ordered, Yinlong will definitely echo any of her claims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if these are all discretionary: "In any case, we still have three people... well, everyone will escape together. Tara Are you confident in dealing with throwing guns and magicians?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That..." Reneka made a random move between make-up and ground-breaking breakthroughs, and the Free Army issued detailed orders. This time it is still the magic communication that rang through the camp. It can be seen that the magicians mobilized by the other party are many and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fighting power of the emperor and his dragon is very dangerous. All personnel must act cautiously and rebuild the line of defense! People without formal mage or pastor qualifications are on guard around! Copper emblem The following mages and priests who do not have the qualifications of the priest are promoted by a group of ten people! The middle and high-level casters search for groups of four to five, gradually narrowing the encirclement! All those who place orders must verify their identity! Non-combatants..."< The male voice hesitated here, and a female voice that sounded familiar was added: "Non-combatants are concentrated in Camp 4, and they must not leave before they are inspected." We have the power to attack people who do not follow the order. Please pay attention! Don't be afraid, the emperor should consume more than half of the magic power, and many one-time effects are also used. Just step by step to consume their magic power!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the order was so long, and both Nika and Olia heard who the publisher was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One, two, three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One, two, three."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 reached out and counted two All over the head, and finally smiled and spread the spreader: "A group of four to five people... Are these two guys specifically targeted at us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three people It’s not too small, we can dress up as a free soldier. Tara has a way to do it, and we both dress up, 黛妮卡.” Olia added, “Tara, by the way. Detect the source position of the amplified magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the card, I praised Olia’s calmness and focused on her own. Work up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no time to make up, change the hair color. Don't be too conspicuous, dark yellow and black are better. Go to pick a helmet, no cover. That would cause suspicion. Change the clothes to start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camp that can accommodate 40,000 people is still quite small. "Be able to rush out before the Free Army," the princesses did so at first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the plan is always in tragic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to the frontline?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be able to stabilize. The flag has been commanding the battle, but it has been moved backwards. There is a strict order on the top, and even if you die here, you can't let the dragon fly back again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, the killing of the emperor is a direct upgrade to the third level, granting a first-class freedom medal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red and blue officers chatted and blocked the camp All roads outside. Most of them hold old-fashioned chasers who don't know which warehouse to search for. The design of these handcuffs can be traced back to the times of the South and the Duke. Each infantry squad set up a new type of air-to-air projectiles with an elevation angle of seventy-five degrees, enough to intercept the dragons hovering at low altitudes. There are no airborne fuzes in this era, but the wizards can manually detonate the shells in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The squad over there, return the system, block the intersection there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am wearing a sergeant's uniform and screaming at the silvery gray of the chest, and I sang a military ceremony." She skillfully directed the team around her to block the intersection without causing any doubt. After the officers left, they found an excuse to cross a warehouse and continue to move toward the next squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The action is too fast. How many hands are they getting back?" Olia snorted and said when she was around. She and 黛nica have always maintained a tacit two-meter distance, sandwiching the silver dragon in the middle - this will ensure that no one has a chance to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter how many people, they probably don't think we can mix it in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They really only have three people, but on the way they can always find ordinary soldiers to command. The blockades at various intersections are their best protection. This trick has been tried and tested. The vast majority of the soldiers have no resistance to the lies of the opposite sex. Besides, they are searching for the emperor. No one would have thought about the relationship between several women and the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being served in the warehouse. Command two teams and pass a blockade line. Grain warehouse. No one's road. Hay warehouse. Command a small team and pass a blockade line. stable. And Ma Wei guards chilling, mixed with a search team. Unmanned barracks. Unmanned barracks. Unmanned barracks...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large open space suddenly appeared in front of their eyes. It is a training ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This training ground is a transportation hub. From here to the north you can directly highlight the camp. The interception firepower on the road will not be very strong, it is a good take-off location." He shrugged his shoulders. "The enemy is a little bit more, but the configuration is not strong. There are not a few casters, and the skills are still very weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we What are you waiting for? Take off." Olia urged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 hesitated. The standard of Silver Dragon's "more points" looks a bit low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least thirteen or four rows of troops on the site, as well as a mountain of chasing rifles and projectiles. A team of officers is distributing these anti-aircraft weapons to the detachment of a team and then arranging them to defend - if the weapon density is high, it is definitely the highest. If the caster density...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head and pointed to an officer in the distance and asked, "Mara, you are sure that the person’s magic reaction is weak. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very weak, very weak..." Miss Yinlong tried hard to find a suitable metaphor, "probably with the wyrmling, no, and the dragon egg "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica knows that the dragon, like the Koman royal family, is a race that condenses some magic in the blood, but she still doesn't understand. This metaphor: "What about me, what is the equivalent of a dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is about the age of ten to twelve years old."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And that person is only equivalent to a dragon egg?" Yanika's brow wrinkled. "You are not joking. Why is she hiding her magic?" ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olilia narrowed her eyes and recognized the man. "Isn't that the Anne of the Logistics Department?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja turned his own toe on the ground and dug a small pit:" According to my judgment, her magic should not be weaker than me. And why is she in this position? She is still using the sound reinforcement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" She is really embarrassed, but that doesn't mean she is not smart. There may be ambushes." Oriya also understood another meaning of her own. "First command a force and make a decision here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the troops in the vicinity were commanded by officers. They did not dare to disturb, and they returned to the previous intersection to find a team of non-commissioned officers who were not enough. Go back to construction. They mixed in the slowly marching squadron and moved back to the training ground in a low-key manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three sergeants, eleven soldiers. Three chasing scorpions, one throwing gun, one magical detection scepter. You are too weak, go Search and alert in the north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s voice was a little hoarse, and her eyes were a little absent-minded. The natural beauty is concealed under the fluffy hair and some dry lips, which can indirectly see the hard work required to prepare for a large offensive. Her sluggish eyes only turned around on the shoulders of several people, and mechanically let the non-commissioned officers send the princesses equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unsurprisingly, our ranks have been placed on the periphery." Yanika breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that the group had crossed the most dangerous Checkpoints...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a moment, a few non-commissioned officers, can you ask a question code about the epaulettes?" Annie suddenly stopped them from behind." Please forgive me for being careless, but I did forget which company or department has three female officers. Which army are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this question, Jenny The heart of the card re-mentioned the eyes of the blind. She coughed and turned and replied: "The three of us are not a single unit. They just formed a small team in order to follow the collective order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way ... This temporary team will be very hard." Annie nodded. "Hurry up and search, do your best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Search! Search! Do you see that little expression?" She snapped. "We are a temporary team, but we must also sigh! Let's go now and search for the damn emperor! You are here to monitor , let's search for the grain store here! For freedom!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reassured, sir! We will stare at the sky!” the soldiers shouted "For the sake of freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are leaving!" Renee stuck with a companion in both hands and broke into the unfinished grain store until it was confirmed that no one was following I came up with a glimpse of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olia stared at her with a complex look, gently bulging her palm: "It’s so beautiful, no wonder you can pass all over us. The person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinika waved his hand and revoked the previous magic, and the two returned to the same appearance. "You said it was easy, I was nervous every time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and laughed at the same time. The previous hostility seemed to be no longer There is no trace of the film. After returning to the emperor, it is another question. Mara also took off her military uniform, stretched her arms, and prepared for the takeoff...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then the explosion came from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brightness around it suddenly increased, and the sun reflected from the gap caused by the blast. The high grain was washed down by the blast, some sacks were cut, and the corn kernels and grains inside poured out and danced in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dispel all the magic inside! All chase is full of strings!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six Masters Simultaneous Waving the dispersing staff in his hand, more than ten muskets and twenty chasing scorpions aimed at them from all directions. The two ladies who were stripped of makeup from the rough climbed up from the dry corn kernels and looked at the direction of the sound. The familiar male voice suddenly became close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then actually condescended to make up a woman, but we can't just let you go. Stop the resistance, the emperor!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door; the figure of Solitaire's high spirits accompanied by the afternoon sun, appeared in the original wall, holding a magic wand with green light in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before his eyes, he did not anticipate the "employed women, panicked" imperial emperor, only...the two people he knew and he did not know One person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't resist." Renee whispered to the two of them and spread their hands, indicating that they were not armed. "Long time no see, Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of the door was condensed. He bitterly asked the encircling troops to step back two steps, and he whispered in front of him: "How is it again, 黛nica? Is it you from the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 put his hands behind his head and his lips sighed: "It’s so smart, Soleton. The details are not too much, you can guess. If you are the commander, the troops brought back. Will it be no more than 500 people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, three hundred people. The rest are all scattered soldiers on the spot."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 continues to ask: “All the sound reinforcements are bait? How do you know where we are?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The utility is not calculated. When you land, it is on fire. The fire points are all in the same area. The deployment is as good as this." The door shrugged. "Exaggerating our power forced you to spend time." In terms of countermeasures, use the sound-sounding magic to paralyze your sense of time and direction, and we have a chance to block you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olivia I laughed. "It’s really troublesome. It seems that I have to do more. I’m totally in the middle of it...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I estimate that even if we didn't detect their magical position, They also have other plans.” Renee comforted Olia and looked around with vigilance. “Is that person not here?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The doorman measured her tone and didn't say Clade's name: "The person doesn't know it is you, he didn't come. But, don't you really think about coming back?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, nuns..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door also wanted to persuade a few words, but 黛妮卡 gently shook his head and stopped him. There are many reasons for her heart, and each one sounds a little bit reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t want to be a general-duty daughter who doesn’t want to live a life of constant life, doesn’t want to rely on the power of others, and doesn’t want to believe in education and publicity from childhood. I want to see the truth and reason of the war, to find the meaning and purpose of my existence, to win status, wealth and glory, to want my own business, love and partners... but in the final analysis, all these reasons Not very convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are living standards. The daily life of the big nobility is not comparable to that of a democratic country. The general's salary is not meager, but there is not much left to buy luxury goods imported from the east... Of course, this is not very convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is...what can she get back? What did she leave and have a chance to get? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 shook his head firmly and replied: "Thank you, no need. You have found your goal, but I have not found my goal." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to Olia, who looked at the door, looked thoughtfully: "Are you sure your goal is there?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did my best." 黛妮卡 also glared at Olia and sighed. When she knew that it was a showdown, she asked: "So, what are you going to do this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are willing to stay, I still Can convince the witnesses. Now that you have made the decision, do I still have a choice? The dragon can never take off again. Wait until the battle is over, can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Renee and Olia answered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door regretfully scratched his head and gave an order, "Lless Sefer, do your best."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." The voice came from behind the princesses, accompanied by more explosions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s appearance is still so embarrassing, but the look is completely different. The team she took was the real attack team, and a few eunuchs and pastors were concentrated in her team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the emperor is not here, I really can't let you go." Nanimen also took out the pistol. "The frontline is very urgent, I can't allow it." The dragon took off again. Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a moment," the woman of Silver Dragon suddenly raised her head. "I still have a question to ask you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only have five eunuchs in total." The silver dragon of the class asked patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Currently..." Resist the subconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will be relieved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mara holds the nick and the two hands respectively Olia's waist, jumping backwards, the body turned ninety degrees in the air, facing the door and Anne with the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her left foot is gently grounded, but her right foot is on the ground with a sigh of strength - full strength plus a full weight. In general, when the dragon is in adult form, it will send more than 95% of its weight to a certain dimension, otherwise most houses and furniture will not be able to withstand their existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire warehouse trembled under the real weight of the dragon. The four-sided brick wall had already been blown up by the assault troops, and now the waves have completely collapsed. The thin layer of wood on the roof was directly shattered into powder. When these obstacles went, Tara screamed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Longwei!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen and Annie shouted the word in unison. The two also stepped back a few steps, and the subconscious stood back to back against this power. The rest of the officers and men couldn't help but pull the machine and the guns. These long-range weapons were in the air without aim. Even a few hits had no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
