			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sonyka! Renee! Weilun!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the major pulled the trigger, Anne; Sefer was shouting the name of her friend. I have already gotten off the horse, and I am using the crystal probe and the magic dust to check that the Ninka and Olia of the squad are looking back and looking at the young woman who is rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie took off her hat and waved her blond hair: "I am, Annie! Don't shoot..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compressed air bomb just passed over her, and the huge airflow blew her hair. At that moment, more than one person understood the facts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" "Escape!" "Remote Magic!" "Lone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Not only did Shulan, Jenny, and Olia see the magic, but a faint exclamation seemed to come from a distance beyond the defensive circle. But no one has the time to look back: the magic bomb is flying so fast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no Isaac who can use anti-gravity magic, and there is no Jeter who can use force field defense. Even if Anne is now using her magic that transcends the times, it is impossible to stop the implosion. At this time -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usually always confused, tempered, like the beautiful young princess and second-rate pastor Olia; Hugh; Keman actually act Woke up. She pulled out the sword of Xiulan around her at a speed that was difficult to capture with the naked eye, and threw it out against the shooting line of implosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can believe in their own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of action of the implosion gun just hit the "Flying Sword", the sword really blocked the ballistic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jianfeng pieces are broken. The compression energy exploded, and the iron filings turned into countless tiny shrapnel shrapnel, which sprinkled over the crowd. Not enough to be fatal, but enough to cut through the skin and penetrate the muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, before the arrival of these "shraps", the blast of the explosion has arrived one step ahead. The people around them were knocked down by the waves, but they also escaped the thousands of high-speed flying iron filings, mostly without injuries. Only a few people were unlucky: Chase; Brighton was blown into the defensive circle and was hit by paralysis and demon. Unprepared Anne rolled down from the wind, and the military uniform was covered with dust, and the "swords" were barely blocked by the mount. Only one person in the blasting circle of the iron filings stood still. It was a tall guardian knight. Most of the iron filings penetrated the outer coat, leaving numerous scratches on the inner layer of the lining; a few iron filings ran across his cheeks, and blood oozing from the wound, but he was unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiu Lan spit out a word with difficulty. "Royal blend..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the word, Rasta was a glimpse and then excited: "Royal cocktail?! Actually... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around you are confused about this conversation. Radz; Govard snorted with irritability and interrupted their inexplicable conversation: "Don't be too happy, this gun produced a total of three! There are two more, how to deal with this lady? "Is there any more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think there is any more." Xiu Lan squatted beside Olia who fell to the ground after throwing the sword." 'Royal cocktail' has side effects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing the situation, the former marshal frowned. "Dissipate! Don't be wiped out by the other party!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, you don't have to spread out!" Anne's voice inserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl slammed into the waist of the ground, crawling up a little hard, and spread her arms around the crowd to escape. "Do not fire on the city! Soledon, stop the sniper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is she going to do?" Xiu Lan shook her hand to the back, but After grabbing an empty space, he had to press his hand on the pistol at the waist to monitor the red-haired female ensign who seemed to be under threat. Yanika pressed his gun down and his face looked very complicated and hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sain, who saw this scene in the city, just hanged a sneer in the corner of his mouth and took off the second implosion gun from behind. The doorman who had been watching was hurriedly rushed to grab the barrel of the engraved circuit and the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lieutenant! You will go to the military court in this way!" The gendarmerie captain shouted. "The following female lieu is also, you are making escapes to the enemy." Opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but..." The door was screaming, "But Anne Lieutenant is our colleague! What if you missed it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Globe! This is the best chance. She has attracted the enemy together! As long as I hit it accurately, she will not be seriously injured! Don't disturb me. Shooting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sain’s words could not be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden acid ray came from behind Anne and passed by her ear. She looked back like the other people who saw this green light - the magical rays, from outside the defensive circle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through everyone’s vision, interrupted all their thoughts, this dark green ray hit the eyes of the major. The special shooter screamed, let go of the gun, and slammed his eyes into a ball. The door immediately slammed the body down, grabbed the gun and stalked a few steps, looking through the optical sight at the direction of the unusually accurate ray. He couldn't help but exclaim when he saw the scene there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Was it like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder that the range of the sour ray magic is so Far, aiming is so accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shooter is wearing a blue Northern Army uniform. It was the chief, colleague and subordinate who fought side by side with him last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the "Ray Queen" Isis; Captain Magnum, his direct commander in the past month. That is Ega; Lieutenant Colonel Eugen, the chief staff officer of the government's Fortress. The number of horse-riding infantry units is small, and the military uniforms are dirty, but the military uniforms are neat. Probably because Robert gave up his pursuit of mission and rushed to the road, they did not suffer too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands: the chips on the table have changed. They are betting on points, but they may not win. This is why the opponent dares to use the strongest combat power as a bait and venture to take the East Gate. Can they still convince Renee in this situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The outside of the city wall is all enemies! You hurry and take people out to support the second lieutenant of Sefer! Today's things depend on her!" The four cavalry screamed. They also know the seriousness of the situation and leave. After everyone left, the teenager subconsciously grasped the newly-launched implosion gun, staring at the red captain, the seven fugitives and the nearest one. Unless they suddenly have a master like General Lopez, otherwise...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not find his palms have been soaked by cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides of the city and the city are facing each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two casters, together with a total of 30 fewer cavalry platoons and guard classes, a wide range, powerful but not worthy in the eyes of professionals A detection defense array. This is all her chips, plus a little friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound and the detection of magic know that the other party has at least five casters, a nearly 100-person horse infantry company, some of which are more than just " The extent of generalization. The reason why it is "some" is because she only sees two of them shot: one can use the ray magic to hit the target at least seven hundred meters away, and the other can intercept it in the blink of an eye with a normal long sword. Live an implosion. If she wants to add what she knows, there is a young mage who invented enough spells to record into the standard magic book. From the average level of these people, the rest of the people will not be worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems difficult to solve the problem by negotiation, and the gap between the forces is even greater. Anne; Sefer has been slow to turn around and seize the time to think about countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not so many people are on the lookout, it will be easy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels An urge to burn. Indeed, if all of her magic is used, it would be easy to get Govar to be re-captured. But here is the most central part of the civilized world. It is not the center of the ocean far from human society. It is impossible for her to witness all the witnesses. Without the magic of later generations, she has no confidence to rival these people. If it caused the attention of the big role of the arbitration association or the wilderness, she would not have the confidence to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light hooves approached the squad, and it stopped exactly at the edge of the influence of the squad. Listening to the voice is also a young woman, she guesses that it is the magician who will use the extended range ray. Since the other party said so, Annie had to laugh back and look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really you, Anne?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica dropped the crystal probe in his hand Awesome, flying up, holding on to the blonde girl. Anne was rushed by her and stepped back two small steps. The two hands didn't even know how to put it. She combed her hair and struggled a little bit: "That, don't you have to be so excited? I have to breathe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡臂Relax a little. "Why are you wearing military uniforms? Just heard you call my name, I can't believe it is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Military clothing is a long story Annie took a deep breath and thought of an excuse. "I came to take the lost girl home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Yanika is a stiff Release your hand and jump a few steps backwards. The tone becomes very cold. "Is it Kladna? Do you want to use it? He even wants to use it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found out that I was wrong again, and Anne’s heart yelled Wonderful, hurriedly argued: "No, no, it’s the nun who asked me to come back to you. I just got a reserve rank from Klad’s adjutant... or I can’t come to you.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the news that someone who sees him as a true parent, Ninika’s heart is warm, but the war is not completely eliminated: after all, she hasn’t figured out how Anne I can know that she is here. She didn't pick up Annie's topic and changed her direction and asked: "Is the nun and the teacher okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You missed their first reply? They didn't encounter any disasters.” Anne hesitated, and decided to throw the killer out now. “There is a very good news, I think you will definitely hear it.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Seneca vaguely guessed her news and asked with expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sordenton is alive. He is now on the head of the city, directing the cavalry platoon you saw." Annie tried to calm the tone. "Now his rank is higher than me. You don't have to make up your family letter anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛尼卡 heard this sentence, The eyes are wide. After spending a moment like a stone statue, she took a few steps forward and held the blonde girl again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry... shoulders lend me a little." Renee’s body was much lower than the tall Annie, just leaning on her chest. "He escaped. I thought he would save me later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't cry. Everyone is not all right? Come back." Anne Gently patted Donika’s shoulder. “Everything is gone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls who are looking at each other here, others feel awkward. Shulan and Rasta did not say anything; Parker blushed and sneaked to the side. The older Radz shook his head and turned to follow the commander of the contingent, Ega; Lieutenant Colonel Eugen whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to see him, you can go now. He should be watching it now." Annie slammed the iron and tried to persuade her directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡一声, but quickly got rid of the emotions. "Wait a minute... You won't hurt my friends except me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl from the future knows that the key issue is finally reached. She took another deep breath and said with a sigh: "Sorry, I have a card. We need Mr. Govar to return to Lenny."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The warm atmosphere was swept away and everyone looked a glimpse. Xiu Lan clenched the handle, and Rasta couldn't help but put his hand on the hilt in the back. This nienick friend doesn't look too good to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie...you..." 黛妮卡 looked up and looked at the left side and looked at the right side. I didn't know what to say at the moment. "Why? Why is this? Why is this happening?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie stunned her eyes and saw her team are following up, a little peace of mind. "If I don't do this, there will be more tragedies. Bonnie is in Ruhrock, I can't allow Ruslock to throw into the empire - even if it is neutral. If this happens, the emperor will definitely go south." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry. Indeed, they are our friends with us; but if we are not successful here, there will be thousands of times innocent people who have lost their lives. Sorelton and I are here for this purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s attitude is very firm. She did not ask Sorelton, but she believed he would agree with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Anne was negotiating with 黛妮卡, Naimen; Soledon was hesitant at the top of the fortress. He couldn't hear the conversation below, and he could only see the situation there through the sight. Although the cavalry platoon had arrived not far behind Anne, they were nothing compared to the one-on-one horseman on the other side of the defensive circle. He has sent someone to request reinforcements, but it is estimated that no reinforcements will arrive within half an hour. The main force is in the north, and he simply can't raise enough combat power to stop Janika and Govar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he can hear is only the words of his former opponent and his current colleagues. Major Thain is no longer embarrassed. He resists the pain of his eyes with the unwillingness of ordinary people. The other party is not an old blinding spell, but an acid line that can directly burn the eyes with a high-precision super-magic. The pain can be creepy even if you imagine it - but he can still speak! Thinking of this, the heart of the door can not help but gave birth to his respect, the hatred that was formed during the battle with the major last night has already been thrown into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squatted close to him and cleaned his wounds with clean water made from magic - the corroded wound looked terrible. After washing all the acid on the face of the major, the door whispered softly in his ear: "Yes, open your eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why why? Black... No.” Thain opened his eyes and the door saw that the white of the eyes had completely turned green and black. His voice is a little fuzzy and hoarse, but he can still understand. He can understand the feeling of a special shooter suddenly blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that Thain accepted the facts almost immediately. "Lieutenant, what's the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the question from Thain, the door shook his head and replied: "They have not broken the defensive circle. Lieutenant Phil has already taken people down to persuade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Constance sneered, this sneer sounded very painful. "Persuasion? Useless, shoot, kill Govar. Now the other party won't notice you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible! Our people are all Below! Shooting at this distance, they will die too!" Naomi was shocked and said, "This is absolutely impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That wait, wait until You can't miss the only chance. If we don't kill Govar here, we will face the biggest civil war - even the fifth free war! You must shoot, Lieutenant!" Hear his hesitation Sain glared with his eyes open. "It doesn't matter who is credited, but the civil war can't be expanded any more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... we will convince them We can certainly convince them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is not confident enough. Here are Anne and Renee...do you convince Renee? This is too difficult. His hands kept shaking, monitoring the position of each person through the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica and Annie are hugged together, Govar is five steps away from them, the gloomy man is not tall, six steps away, and the two strong fighters and The faint women are together. The Ruhrocks fainted, and the soldiers outside the wall planted a large amount of magic dust to save him. They were analyzing the structure of the defensive array. The magic dust flew in the air, reflecting the iridescent light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two steps of Xiulan’s step was to insert a dialogue between Yanika and Annie. "No, our empire is also for peace. The people of Ruhr Locke have been exploited too much in order to guard against us. This is a good opportunity to completely change the chances of our confrontation between the North and the South. We can negotiate peace and do not have to Bundle Ruslock in the chariot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Knight, how can you guarantee that the emperor will not go south?" Renee retorted. She understands the emperor's emperor - it is not a bad person, it is just an idealist. It is similar to her own, so it is dangerous. "Don't talk about justice, let's talk about interests directly. If you let us succeed today, the Lenny government will lose control of the Julesian army. Even the best situation is nothing more than restitution. Today, if we are here Stop you, you can accept the entire Northern Army within a week. The war was over last night, and it should not be revived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you will not be tried. I have not received any orders to capture you. You are free to leave. I only hope that Lord Gowar can condescend to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anne smiled softly in a demonic manner, stepping forward in two steps, standing in the wind full of magic dust. Her right hand and left hand danced rhythmically, and the surrounding magic dust gradually gathered to form two swirls of different colors. She also prepared at least two different magics - the light is enough to surprise all the wizards present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this the multiple rays of Captain Itis? Sorry to disturb, can this threaten us, less?" Eugen in the chewing gum The school spoke in time to remind the other of their existence outside the defensive circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks a lot like the "multiple rays" that Isis is good at, but the captain himself knows that this is totally different. She leaned closer to Eugen and whispered in his ear: "Be careful. Although the opponent is at a disadvantage, her confidence will not be unreasonable. I want to ask Major Cousin to quietly detect it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although we are few people, there are not as many casters as you, but we are confident that we can cause you enough damage." Annie's well-thought-out smile looks a bit like her sister, "we I only need Lord Govar to stay, and the rest of you can leave safely. I believe this is a very good deal, and we will not lose anyone. Most importantly, I don't want anyone to be sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry...please let us consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the final decision maker, Xiu Lan Hesitated. He looked at Yanika: the girl with short brown hair was staring blankly at the magic dust, and muttered something in her mouth. He also turned his heart to the direction of the old Marshal; even if he only "considered", he also felt that it was difficult to say it. Gore understands and smiles: "You are free. Actually, I have no plans to be rescued at all. Even if I go back, Clade will do my best to protect." Mine, you don't have to worry about it. No matter what the result is, I won't bring you in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xu Lan turned to Rasta and liberated the knight Just shrugging: "I don't care. Anyway, I probably can go back alive... I don't expect anything to go up. The problem is only you. If this mission fails, I am afraid that the position of this chief guard is ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A touch of white clouds temporarily covers the sun. The two sides of the confrontation are still squatting, but the surroundings are silent, leaving only the magic dust floating in the dimly lit sunlight. Annie didn't say anything, just smiling quietly and inscrutablely, keeping her pressure. She saw that Xiu Lan was very annoyed with her head and struggled, knowing that she was about to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is also nervously looking at the scene through the scope. He slowed his breath, moved the telescope gently, and grasped everyone's position. Govar has just gone a little further...just outside the range. If the negotiations break down, he has the confidence to hit directly - after all, he has also practiced shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But does he really dare to open this shot? The pressure was too heavy, and he couldn’t breathe. What should I do if I accidentally hit Yanika and Annie? What happens once he really kills Govar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shooting...!" In order to convince him, Thain was already dry-mouthed and could only try his best to repeat the word. But the door is still afraid to shoot... he does not trust himself. He doubts his ability and judgment. Every minute of the implosion gun is like an hour to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in the past, I don’t know how many seconds, Xiu Lan finally opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I decided..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch it." Itis jerked her head up Come, she caught the reflection of the sight. "Patience with acid does not give up, it is really a man. Unfortunately, you are not on our side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door on the wall suddenly feels different. In an instant, he closed his eyes violently - but at the last moment before closing his eyes, he saw the green light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark green acid magic rays. Accurate and error-free. Although he closed his eyes, he was still a step late: his left eye had seen the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
