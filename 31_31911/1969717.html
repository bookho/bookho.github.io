Calikat Alvarez, the elf name known as the Lei Li Tuo by the Taoist, almost wiped out the entire Yellow Army army in Fuxi, leaving a deep humiliating memory for the peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all the cities that believe in the Taiping Road, the yellow-bottom Taiji flag of the Taiping Road flutters over the anti-Dibao. This flag is known as the "Tai Chi Fish" by Western countries. It consists of a beautiful circle of black and white patterns. It is a symbol of all religions and sectarians who follow the path of the supreme road and pursue the only right way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, one-half of the standing force of the entire western province of the province was stationed under this banner, always ready to resist the aggression of more Elf Legion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the elf army they were waiting for came, but with a white flag symbolizing peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the leader of this elf army, Jiawen Alvarez, is in the squatting house of the Fortress’s residence, leaning against a very lady’s sitting position Zhang Huang Yang wood carved on the chair of the Tianshi, holding a tea pot in his hand, and calmly waiting for the call of the owner of this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few decades ago, this style of relatively fashionable Oriental furniture is still very uncommon in the world of Taiping, and the Taoists still prefer the Mazar, the low bed and even sit on the ground. However, after the wise Sunsen and the Eastern merchants renamed the imported chair of the original "Tai Shi Chair" as "Tianshi Chair", it swept the officialdom of the Taiping Road countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She brought four elves and quasi-elf aristocrats to serve as guards, all murderous and brave. She wants to let the other party know that she is not going to vote with the defeated army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the facts are not far from this. Just three days ago, the Freedom Fleet, which ran across the entire Qianlong Sea, landed in Jiawen Fegna and swept the Elf Colony Corps and its captains and colonial governors stationed in the colony. Jiawen used the authority of the guardian of the people and took out the titles of several honorable citizens of Shengsen. Only then, the defeated soldiers and the refugees were reorganized into a colonial detachment with a sinister face and a unicorn flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This chair is finally more comfortable than when I came last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf Care The officials gently took a sip of tea and recalled the memories of dealing with these people decades ago. They didn't want to make too many courtesy mistakes. In recent years, officials of the Taoist people have taken the initiative to go to Jiawen Feige to meet the representative of Sansen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guizhou Taishou, General Detro, Fuxi Deputy Governor, Zhu Juzhi's adults summoned Shengsen to make Lei Jiawen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard at the door stretched his throat and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The name of this gentleman means 'decisive person'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One before As a translator, the quasi-elf who had been in the East Empire for many years stood up and explained to Jia Wen, who did not understand the oriental language. Several other elves and half-elves also followed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really falling down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen’s mouth hangs a sneer. The attitude of the former Taiping officials was not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade with Sansen has brought great benefits to the three provinces on the Taiping Peninsula, and the deputy governor of the state It is the biggest source of profit, the light checkpoint tax and the investigation of contraband goods make the warlord make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really a bully, protect the people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter. And by They perform."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every elf knows that interest and politics are two things. In the era when Hongrinasti ruled the entire continent, the elders of the Elven capital began to play politics - until they lost the entire Elf Empire, they were still playing the smart and wise politicians. Will play the power game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiawen understands that the other party’s statement is conveying a message: the other party already knows the news of the fall of Jiawen Feige, and intends to use this for profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved her guard to stay in the house, got up and translated and followed the guard out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire anti-Diebao official residence is heavily guarded, but it reflects the true nature of this as a military fortress. However, the Yellow Turban soldiers who barely put on the majesty posture did not look like the heroic warriors who had been through the battlefield. It was like a servant who was barely dressed in military uniforms - just like the "guard" who led the way in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wide square with decorations such as drums, rattan, coat of arms, stone lions, etc., it is the official residence of the Anti-Dyborg. Before the Zhengtang, two yellow-bellied warriors armed with great battles stopped the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly disassemble the weapon, Siddi!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their battles intersect, issue The crisp metal crash is actually a big gun of the whole iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They ask you to hand over the weapon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard the famous oriental text The translation of the quasi-elf euphemism, Jia Wen sighed softly, and removed the short sword from the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid there is no such a word at all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for the people around you to show their pride The smile, she will slash the sword with the scabbard to the center of the trenches where the two yellow-bellied soldiers crossed! The power of this cast was so ingenious that the two strong men changed their faces, and the big one in one's hands swayed, and the other's big cockroaches simply fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf smiled, and her sensitive ear heard a whispering "You are not saying that she is asking for reinforcements, Master". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head and deliberately raised her voice: "If I want to assassinate your prefects, even if there are no weapons, someone in this yard can stop it." I?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become one of the ten servants of the Sanctuary, and one of the ten servants of the sage, Jiawen Alvarez Have confidence. She knew from the beginning that the reinforcements of the Taiping Dao could not be sought by whispering! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer to her is a hardwood impact. Jia Wen heard the kind of impact; the people of the Eastern Empire seemed to call it "Gavel", and the effect and effect were a bit like the big clock in the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the Nasi women messenger coming in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bit of annoyance sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They ask you to go in for a discussion-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't have to be translated. While waiting I found a less accurate listening magic from the magic net, and I will use it. I don't think it is necessary to translate too accurately today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia Wen completely ignored the three yellow towel soldiers around him. If no one finished talking, he crossed the high threshold and walked into the official hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most Daomin Taoists, General Anti-Druid Zhu has a brown face, a beard and a rough skin like the archipelago. It doesn't look like the yellow empire of the Eastern Empire. However, these people verbally praised the "true messenger of the right way" and put "must regain the giant deer". This kind of heart-rending and high-sounding style is the style of the oriental bureaucratic empire that governs the country with morality. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the most powerful man in the southern part of the western province of the province is staring at Jiawen’s beautiful and statue-like face, swallowing himself. A sip of water. Among his wives, there is a sub-elf with a quarter of elf blood, which is very satisfying to him; but in front of the 100% pure blood elf, the mixed elves can only be eclipsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can see that the woman who led the Elf Army and is in a high position is behaving in a courteous manner, cautious and proud, and apparently born from a big family - similar to Taiping There are very few large families in the country that have stretched for hundreds of thousands of years and the county can be traced back to Middle-earth. The women of these big families did not dare to think about such a martial artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was in a daze for the beauty and temperament of the other person, Jia Wen spoke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the Guardian of the Elven People and the Senate, the eldest daughter of Calicut Alvarez, Jiawen Alvarez. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quasi-elf translation translated word by word: "The guardian is Lei Jiawen, the daughter of Lei Li Tuo."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the name of Lei Li Tuo, the unforgettable name of the Taiping Taoist country, Zhu decided to return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this will be decided by Zhu. I would like to ask the guardian to come to the army, what is the intention?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Ali has left a step for the other side. According to him and his master, the elf’s defeat this time is unprecedented, and it is a good opportunity for him to expand his power and compete for power. If the elf is going to ask his reinforcements to recover the state, he doesn't care to bite a large piece of meat from these pointed ears... It would be better if he had a chance to take a bite in front of the lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came here, bringing the goodwill and advice of the Senate and Jiawen Fegner. A powerful Intre Free Army, a few days I had captured Jiawen Fegner before and defeated our local garrison. With the strength of this army, they are entirely likely to continue to attack Detroit. Therefore, I came with the army and hoped to help General Zhu. Guarding the city until we bring in more fleets and reinforcements to defeat the enemy. I hope that the generals will not act arbitrarily. This South Koman army is not a militia, but a strong army that has experienced bloody battles on the mainland. It is by no means an opponent that the general's troops can defeat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a Red Army, a siege, a sharp, and all-in-one... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of language barriers, one of Zhu Ding began to listen to Jiawen with a smile and listen to the translation, but he couldn’t feel right when he listened to him. It is. Even after the modification of translation, this is not a good advice, but a face-to-face humiliation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Anti-Di general has been a Hummer career for more than forty years. He has led a new army under the command of Luo Ruide, and has participated in the jihad against the East. For many years, the record of the face is so unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean by this girl is that we can't just win the Red Army, even this Anti-Fortress can't keep it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case. So, I am kind enough to come here to provide the general with an elf reinforcement. As long as the general provides us with appropriate compensation and supplies, we will Let the incoming Indy Army encounter a bloody run. You can make the general peace of mind that we will not ask for more rights for our services, even if Jiawen Feige came to the new Governor, and Our service has nothing to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quasi-elf ear responsible for the translation shook a little, but translated the words according to the meaning of Jia Wen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, he heard half of it, and Zhu decided to grab the tea pot on the table with a hand that was stretched with blue veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough is enough. Drop off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the official customs of the Eastern Empire, once the owner Picking up the samovar means that the guests can leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jia Wen sighed and smiled: "I am really kind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That translates to inform her about the meaning of the two words. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the tea delivery, especially the hate, General Zhu, throwing the tea on the ground and smashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, Jia Wen pressed his hand on his chest and bowed slightly, still calmly exiting the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two elves disappeared outside the door, the master of the side frowned and coughed twice, reminding the Lord of the family: "Adult, this girl." Although it’s arrogant, it’s not necessary to have a general knowledge of it. We can’t miss this radical law.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I naturally know.” Zhu decided to sit back On the chair, Shen Shen, there is no anger in the complexion. "This woman wants to provoke us to fight against the newcomers in Guozhou. The intention is too obvious. How can I have such a naive strategy? The sharp ears and long eyebrows are shallow and thin, and they are similar to the beasts. It is not natural."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why isn't the adult not guilty and arrogant, but wants to tear the face in public?" Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, although this woman is very excited, but what she said is to vent her cards. The Red Army is brave and good, she is not fake, she The army is going to have no way to go, and it is not a fake, only to come up with this method of selling as a mercenary. She keeps saying that local reinforcements must arrive, showing that they actually do not have any foreign aid in the short term."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhu is in a good mood, gently tapping the table with the gavel in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She stressed that the Reds will be going north, but it can be seen that the Reds are not meant to me. The expedition, loneliness, new In the land of redemption, the Red Army is now also cautious. We should seize this opportunity and sign a new peace treaty directly with this brave and prosperous Red Army. Isn’t it better than entanglement with these Xidi?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To control the country, the adults really see it!" The teacher listened to his conviction, "No wonder to drive these Xidi people out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they are used, the negotiations with Hongyi will be subject to their constraints. If they say that they are not good, they will have to make a matter of going to the night and attacking the night. Why is it so hard?" When I got up, I fell into a book bag like a literati. "It’s a pity that this beautiful woman has no chance to kiss Fangze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher smiled with a smile Two sounds, the other soldiers in the lobby also laughed with their generals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Jiawen Alvarez is walking outside the door with a few listless guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards have heard the news of the Zhu Zhizhi’s dispatch to the guards, and they know that their troops will no longer be able to stay in the city, the emotions are It seems very low, and the lively market in Detroit cannot mention the slightest interest of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Jia Wen himself seems to be in a good mood. She often stops at the market and buys some interesting ornaments or magical items in the style of Taiping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not leading a true Sanctuary, and people do not have the obedience of real soldiers. Finally, after the pedestrian left the market and opened the tracker of the Taiping Road, some people couldn’t help but ask: “The Guardian. We are about to be forced to leave here, and they have not promised to give us Any reinforcements, is this okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female escort responded with a new haircut and replied: "No reinforcements? Yes, they Did not promise me, but we have already received reinforcements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I think this general Zhu is not like a man who dares to take risks." The translation of the quasi-elf also raised objections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This general Zhu will take the soldiers." Jia Wen smiled. "This general will never pay attention to our warnings and threats, but he He will not take the soldiers to attack Jiawen Fegner. He will only take the army to the road, protect himself, and show it to the new owners there. Try to negotiate some cheaper back. A very safe and profitable To the best interest program. I am afraid he is laughing at me now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the problem, the servant of the people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is that the new owner there will not necessarily make the same judgment with him." Wen bowed her head and replaced her bracelet. "And we will not give them the opportunity to think so. The lonely army is hanging overseas, there is no fleet in the port, the outside of the city is all enemy... They will patiently negotiate with the army outside the city. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clenched the changed bracelet, and the communication magic contained in the bracelet slightly glowed blue. That communication magic is linked to another well-known guardian. He is now commanding a powerful fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even with patience, this patience will not last long. At that time, it is our chance. I hope that you will work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if the Intrepid won?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question did not even give Jiawen a moment of hesitation, She has had an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is of course better. If they can win the anti-Di Army of Fuxi, there will be only one army in the peace-fighting country to defeat them." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can only be the Yellow Turban Army led by Zhang Futu, a teacher of Zhang Futu, who was trained by Clade Lopez and known as the guardian of 660,000 people. The main force of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now we are going to go north to Qingniu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***** ****<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter January 30<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Dragon Sea (westd<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agonsea) Near Yellow Scarf Taiping Road Guohai Westbound Province<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******** *<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five days of change, Jiawen Fegner changed hands in the West Longhai, an unexpected naval battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody thought that in this sea of ​​southerly winds, the opposing fleets with two crosswinds would suddenly encounter. They all thought that their actions were unpredictable, but the wind and the current always like pranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is the fifth and seventh mixed fleet of free navy that rushed to reinforce the main fleet after the surprise attack. They sailed from east to west and planned to Within the day, I crossed the corner of the Sinti Peninsula and entered the East Intres. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one received an urgent report from Jiawen Alvarez, decisively decided to leave the two-sea fleet, and rushed back to recover the lost Sansen guard. fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been eight hours since the two strikers discovered each other. Since ancient times, the timetable for large-scale naval warfare has been extremely long, and it has been long enough to drive the average person crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is even worse when both commanders are well-known and experienced naval generals. The sailors needed to control the ship's voyage for several hours. The gunners had to fill the cannonballs and gunpowder in rounds and rounds, and the ship's mage and priests were tossed to exhaustion. If someone has a leisurely observation of the magic net structure of the West Qianlong Sea, you will be able to see huge line nodes in the vicinity of the battlefield. All the magic power has overflowed, and the magic gun, wind direction control and magic items are intertwined. Form a colorful silk clump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The left avant-garde detachment has been out of contact with the enemy fleet! Please give instructions, the commander of the fleet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The main force of the enemy fleet has made a full breakthrough, the right wing detachment requested chasing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless commands are broken into the magic net through direct communication magic, passed to The fifth fleet commander of the semi-elf Leonard Kikawi's flagship. Every mage on board is busy copying and conveying orders, and many orders are too late to fulfill all the formalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these combat commands, only one command is repeated over and over again through the contact network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the order issued by the Commander of the Kazan Fischer Seventh Fleet Division not long ago. It was this command that made the entire fleet's operations in a stalemate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't contact your flagship of Wei Taiping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-edited fifth The commander of the fleet, the half-elf Kikawi, did not join the chaos. He was walking around in the fleet's command cabin, waiting for the duty magician in charge of the ultra-long-range communication to give a report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For him, this contact is far more important than the ongoing naval battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been three days. From the Seventh Fleet, the respective fleets are responsible for contacting the ship's mage and the pastor. They have not received a response. It should be a unified silence. The detailed contact of the magic net can not be located, the large-capacity magic items known on the fleet have been sealed, and the high-ranking caster has no action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "There is a murder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warlord was also invented by Wei Taiping and was first put into use in the war in the Far East. The precious magical power of the ship is used to reserve combat magic, refill the implement, make the reel, strengthen the hull and the magic cannon. Of course, the other party cannot detect the direction of the main force of the fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under land warfare, naval warfare is an absolute hard power competition. An army may collapse overnight because of various reasons, but there is only a competition between the fleet and the fleet for endurance and training. A sea battle is fought for days and nights, and hundreds of ships are chasing and killing within a few hundred nautical miles. No matter the victory or defeat, regardless of the status, even the commander of the fleet may die at any time. In order to maximize the combat power of a fleet in such a war, there is a total silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case... then we don't have to contact him any more. Contact the Dallas Salami deputy commander's ship and inform all the colonel and above. The main captain, everyone is waiting for the order at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard’s fingers are inserted into his hair and combed hard as if to take these days Everything is sorted out clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has the last hour to make a decision. After this time, even if his fleet all turned around and chased, it could not catch up with the elf fleet flying in full sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, the decision to return immediately four days ago, despite the unanimous consent of everyone, is planned beforehand, but it is not a discount. Unbound gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elves remember the scene when they said goodbye to Reza Hermont on the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the volunteers who drove the small yellow towel sailboat had just landed. Hearing the lord of the Hengqu Zong, Haidong Zhang Shiqu Shuai Zhang Shiyi once again erected the news of the Hengqu Zongda Banner. The volunteers who believed in the Hengqu Zong crossed the sea from the Haidong province and came to Guozhou to gather in the Zhang’s battle flag. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of these chaotic cross-river volunteers, Leonard found Reza Hermonte, still wearing a pure gold dress. The "Golden Alchemist of Pure Gold" was tempted by the conditions promised by Miss Zhang Jiada, and was examining strange magical props that represented the ancient and modern alchemy of the Taiping Tao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I and Lieutenant General Kazan Fischer decided to lead the fleet to support Marshal Wei Taiping. Immediately -< =""="">- So I want to find you to come to the individual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s going to sail again. Take care all the way, if you see rare magic materials, remember to buy it for me, big ship. Mr. Chang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, it seems that every time she meets with Reza, the alchemist Missy is somewhat wrong. But maybe the top alchemists are like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After we sailed, there may be no more ships in this port in a few weeks. If there is really an enemy fleet, or There is an enemy siege, you must take care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, rest assured. I am using the technology of the Golden Golem to improve the new magic gun. The filling speed, if your fleet wants to install next time, you can find me, I will give you a good price. Don't look for the accounts that Bonnie hired, the girl is too smart to deal with."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, he did not feel any threat to Jiawen Feige. The Elf Corps has been defeated, and the remnants are far away. The Hengqu Zong army that has come from the countries of the Taiping Road grows day by day. From the common sense, the "Intreus" will never allow another fleet to return to recapture the port on the eve of the decisive battle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp But this turned out to be a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can the other party make a decision to split the troops at this time? It is really stupid. Even we all know that we need to help before the war, they actually decided to split up?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts are circulating in my mind. The half-elf shook his head and tried to expel this thought from his mind. It is pointless to complain that the enemy is desperate or not playing according to common sense. Perhaps it is because the two-sea fleet of the elves has entered the dead, so the commander of the defending fleet wants to escape from the tail...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means bud Sha, and all the surprise troops in Jiawen Fegna are in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard really wants to point out that these dozens of ships are going their own way, chasing the tail of the other fleet to Jiawen Feige. If you let this elf fleet, which is not a small force, pass, the surprise troops there will probably repeat the mistakes of the previous Sansen Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can’t act alone. Without the assistance of the ships of the Kazan Fischer Seventh Fleet, even if he catches up, he can't annihilate the huge Elf fleet, but he may be defeated by the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The commander, the flagship of Major General Daro Salami is connected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice of the resident mage interrupted Leonard’s recollection. He nodded and walked quickly to the magic crystal side of the communication. Another magician about three or so was trying to maintain the connection between the communication crystal and another communication crystal. These high-level magic items are so expensive and impractical that they are only available on official ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Commander of Kaikawi." The face of the deputy commander of the Fifth Fleet is not clear in the crystal. "It is about the order of General Lieutenant Fisher." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think we have a way for him to take back this order, General Salami?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard did not ask how Darrow guessed his intentions - because it was too obvious. The flagship of the Fifth Fleet has been delaying the notice of not forwarding the Seventh Fleet down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daluo in the crystal ball looks a bit fatter and looks more like a maritime quotient than a naval officer. His hesitant expression can be seen clearly through the crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I said this is not very appropriate...but you shouldn’t ask me, but the part of your heart as a naval general. Convince another Naval generals can only be used by naval generals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Darrow Salami is known for his gentle and operational skills, it does not mean that he It is an incompetent naval general. This sentence puts out the irritable emotional flame in the half-elf heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To convince a naval general, must use the naval generals..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a naval general who is better than me and should be better at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard Kikawi took a deep breath. He understood that his deputy was advising him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a naval general, Leonard is well aware of what the general silence of Marshal Wei Taiping means. Concentration is the first lesson that every naval commander has to learn. If the Seventh Fleet loses in the big fleet decisive battle, Jiawen Fegner will also fall. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps he can defeat this attempted breakthrough elf fleet with his outstanding commanding ability, but what if the big fleet failed in the final battle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand. Sorry. Thank you. The order is passed down, and the ships of the Fifth Fleet pay attention. If the enemy ships are fighting, they will be resolutely attacked according to the Free Naval Regulations. If the enemy ship tries to disengage, return to the normal route after the end of the attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half elf said this in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he re-called the shipman who was responsible for remote magic communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop contact with Marshal Wei Tai. Contact Major General Dubri Gohau and Governor Neremon Soledon of Jiawen Fegner. On February 4th Before the day, there will be a fleet of nearly two hundred ships approaching..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenard stopped here, hesitating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, sir?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Sorry for being unable to stop. I hope everyone Work hard. End."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-elf shook his head and said the last sentence, turning to the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His flagship also began to wind off the sails, no longer chasing the enemy fleet. After a long time, the sound of the cannons at sea gradually drifted away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep rainy season on February 1<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow towel Taiping Daoguo, Fuxixing Province, Guozhou Prefecture (formerly Jiawen Fegner Concession)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temporary Staff of the Free Army Joint Operations Force<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This news should be known to senior officers. The intermediate officers may not have been formally notified yet, so I will read them again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niemen Soledun Standing in the middle of the staff, he took the message in his hand on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notice of Lieutenant General Leonard Kikawi. His fleet has been out of combat with the enemy fleet."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy fleet is about 100 ships of various types. The commander is the famous conqueror Kotuz, who has made a breakthrough in the cost of about 20 warships. It is expected three days later. The fleet of elves will reach us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And our fleet's choice is to abandon chasing and join the sea war that is supposed to have broken out." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The conclusion is that we will be sustained shelling by an elf fleet before February 4. Now there is a quantity outside our city. Up to 25,000 people may hold hostile Taiping troops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All middle and senior officers are silently looking at the commander of the independent gendarmerie. Nami Soleton is not the highest rank among all, but he is the only senior officer of all who can coordinate the forces of all coalition forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because most of the troops of the Intercontinental Army are newly built, there are not many reliable troops. Nana and the two new teachers have been coordinating for a long time. This unusually large and complex joint surprise attack force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the independent gendarmes, the fourteenth "Zhuhai Division" and the ninth national "Dragon Gunner" each sent an elite group of more than a thousand people In addition, Zhang Shiyi dumped all of his 2,000 cross-channel private soldiers and fleets. Bonnie Sefer also transferred an extremely elite magical reinforcement camp from the thirteenth "Miracle" to join this speculative surprise attack. Among them. Counting Zhang Shiyi and the 13th Division’s battalion commander Tai Lei, there are five commanders with independent command and more than 20 intermediate commanders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These forces are certainly not subtle, but directing them is a big problem. After the capture of the state, Zhang Shiyi’s troops expanded rapidly, and the various departments of the Freedom Army also used the property acquired by the plundering elves to recruit local auxiliary troops and liberate the combat troops – which made the command problem worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire staff was silent at low pressure, and the air seemed to solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation we faced is even worse than the Elf Army who guarded here. The time left for us is not much, so we must come up with a battle today. The program came." Naimen hardened the scalp and broke the silence again. "I don't think I need to repeat the request from the army outside the city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonel Cliff followed him to speak, but he even had some responsibility: "I feel that there is no choice. Three days can't solve the problem of negotiation with them. Three days later, the Elf Fleet will not have to negotiate. When everyone else Call me 'The rabid dog' Cliff... Although it has become a 'broken rabid dog', it should be no problem to charge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two division leaders, The rest of the people also expressed their opinions. Faced with such a huge and unexpected threat, people have proposed various opinions from launching sneak attacks, sticking to support and chartering and evacuating. Only Zhang Shiyi and her officers have been silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorkeeper noticed this. When another Free Army officer finished his opinion, he inserted it: "So, what is your opinion of Zhang Qushuai?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's Zhang Shiyi dyed A red cloak with the same color as the Intres military uniform, wearing an East-style close-fitting nails under the cloak, with a few shiny metal nails embedded in it, and a very formal yellow hair band . The officers around her are dressed according to the arms. The officers wearing the armorless uniforms like the Free Army are the officers of the firearms. Like the Eastern Army, they wear the armor and the cloak. They are the officers of the rifle and the volunteers. As for the military uniforms, they have a few armor. The film and the hand guards and the robes in the wide-sleeved robes are obviously magic warfare officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that now, I think the intelligence and the program are basically unified, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When he heard Zhang’s summary, Nana nodded slightly and asked: “Unified?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes. First of all, we have no reinforcements. Then, there are enemies on both sides of the sea. There are only three options that we can choose to escape, avoid, and fight. Escape can choose land or sea, and you can choose to negotiate, buy, talk, or surrender. You can choose to attack or be fair. The battle, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female channel master of Zhang’s family is young, but the Coman language is very good and the speech is very organized. The opinions of the previous people were summed up very clearly. The Hengqu army generals who followed her were secretly nodding their heads, and they were grateful to the Hengqu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the door to follow up on the topic in a timely manner: "Actually, after the discussion just now, everyone thinks that the feasible solution is only negotiation, buying, sneak attack and frontal battle. Now The problem is, the final decision is which one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now we don't have a unified commander. Like you, I also lived a lot in the free countries." In the year, I like this country very much. One of my favorite things about this country is that these countries can still function normally without the "high and low", and they have defeated one powerful enemy one after another. We are now Is the situation not like the situation faced by the free countries? Why can't we solve it in the same way?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door understands Zhang Shiyi’s thoughts What to say: "Do you mean voting? Traditionally, the Freedom Army voted only within the staff department, and our freelancers did not use voting to solve problems..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our coalition Basically, it is a free army unit without a superior command. At least my and my cross-disciplinary forces do not object to the use of voting. It is better to vote according to the number here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then our miracle teacher also agreed to vote." The thirteenth division had only one captain here, and she got the order to advance and retreat with Nanimen and Zhang Shiyi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you all agree, I agree," said Master Cliff, on behalf of his dragon gunner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes are on the high-ranking Major General who has the largest regular force. The Major General frowned. "Our officers are the most, and there is no reason to oppose it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door nodded and nodded: "Then let me host it." Our time is very urgent. For the first time in our joint operations force of the Free Army and the Cross-Army -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Shiyi inserted: "It’s too long How about the 'Joint Army'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. The first time the Joint Army Staff voted. All the colleagues who agreed to meet, please raise your hand; If you agree to the negotiation, please don't raise your hand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
