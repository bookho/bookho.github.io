Here is Jena, the valley of the wine-scented valley, the battlefield between the emperor and the Freedom Army soldiers. These people shed blood in order to protect their daily lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historic carriage is twisted, and the straw that is about to overthrow it seems to be hidden here, hidden in the troops beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of his eyes, ten people stood in a row, ten rows stood in a company, and eleven squares formed the final reserve team. Each square has a gap, and the deficiencies of the troops are quite obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third temporary combat group has three battalions and one company, with a total of 1,230 troops and 970 actual forces." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the order of Marshal Fox, the non-commissioned officers organized the troops to report to their new chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain jumped off the horse and slowly walked onto the podium, and his heart was up and down. He didn't have to look at his fingers. He also knew that the other side should have at least two thousand combat troops, and the entire battle group had only five hundred veterans plus five hundred new recruits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War is a game of morale on both sides. However, the whiteness of the desperate atmosphere is over the top of this unit, even if there is no magic, the vision can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone in the third temporary battle group, I am Naomi? Captain Soledon, many of you know me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and started his predecessor speech: "You guys! Don’t you think this number is too much trouble? It’s a temporary battle group. It sounds like we are going to be destroyed at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning him is at least 970 surprised and sharp eyes, maybe it should be included A peer who is watching but not a member of the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes seem to be asking: “What are you guys talking about?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Emperor with a thousand years of history has many incredible traditions. For example, there will be a lot of vacancies in the Army. For example, the horses of the cavalry will perform special cuts on the stables, which will give the horseshoes a special order. Will congratulate each other and be interrupted in the battle. The Free Army does not have all sorts of superstitious traditions like the Emperor, but no one is willing to listen to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Change a name, you! Every glorious army of the Free Army has their nickname, 'Republic of the Master', 'The King's Master', 'Double Bladesman's, the troops with the nickname may fail, but they have never been completely eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we cannot be completely eliminated. We have to fight until the sacrifice. We have to live back to our hometown. But these words don't sound like much. The chemicals in the brain are tightly combined with each other, and the magical force shuttles through the gaps in the nerves. The door feels that the tongue does not seem to accept the control of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, like me, never been eliminated, survived. Maybe we don't have any great achievements, and there is nothing extraordinary. Talent, just ordinary people, but we have not been completely eliminated, never! Yes, we all fought in Lenny, fighting in Fort Fort, fighting in Kengler, fighting in St. Fort, fight in Jena, fight here! We are still alive and standing in this vital position! Shouldn't we have a unique title?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have survived. You, me, you, us. We are alive, standing here, for what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scanned the audience. The atmosphere gradually loosened, and many veterans seemed to think of their loved ones and their hometowns. The expression was not as strange as before; some people were still standing, but their hands could not help but rub on their own guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is for our loved ones, lovers, friends and hometown, but not only for our loved ones, lovers, friends and hometown. We have experienced such blood and Fire, you can survive, stand here, for the mission that God gave us! It is a blow to victory and defeat! We are lucky! We are not only the cold 'third temporary battle group', we It was the lucky one standing here to win the final victory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately paused here and took care of the collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think about all the things you have experienced, they are not in vain! The world exists for us! We are struggling to survive in the sludge for this decisive One blow, we sacrificed death in the blood fog for this decisive blow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name magically appeared in my mind. Yes, this is the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are the ultimate reserve team for victory! We are 'good operations'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nanmen knows that it is useless to say anything to these veterans. Only the words "live" are true. In this era of war, which is lined up with each other and the strategy is the collision of geometric figures, "good luck" is what the bottom soldiers are most looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will survive, reverse the results of this campaign and spread our good fortune to the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Nana does not know how much these people can resist at a critical moment. The unit in his hand is the last reserve of the Jena, but it may not be able to compete with the opposing soldiers. After all, he did not command this unit by merit, prestige or feelings. There are some soldiers he has brought, but they can't rely on these soldiers to inspire the morale of the whole camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only leave the dice and gamble on everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand and gestured to the avatars around him The demon Anne raised the flag that had just been taken, and the marshal flag that had not yet been launched also caused a low-pitched exclamation. This is a completely superior authorization, representing the full confidence of Marshal Fox in this team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This unique honour is promised to us by the Marshal! Go to victory, you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The soldiers who used to be farmers, merchants, employees, and craftsmen clenched their weapons and set off on the battlefield where they might have buried their bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the suspension bridge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple suspension bridge passes over the equally sloping trench. These lines of defense are not worth mentioning compared to the luxury of the Fort Stilburg to the impulsive multiple bastion defense. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When digging these trenches and earthen walls, Namimen felt "enough" as a supervising officer; now he has commanded the officer, but he feels "in the beginning It would be nice to dig more earth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With these lines of defense, I am afraid I can't stop an army like the Governor's Army who is not afraid of sacrifice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There must be to stop the opponent before the tide of war is rolled into the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commanding sword at the waist seems to be heavy, and its hilt is colliding with the black-handed gun that carries it, making an annoying squeak. It sounds like his own heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole camp! The recruits are back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain is staring at the front. banner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the field of vision, his colleagues put forward a frontal breakthrough matrix, with only three battalions on the side for the delay . He was afraid that the flags would suddenly fall without warning, and the neat squares would collapse into uncontrolled rivers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully reached the order and placed a triangular array of four thick and thin wings with four hundred people, leaving a few passages in the array for possible defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy's guns are gradually getting thinner. This also means that the enemy feels that it is no longer necessary to have such a strong shelling to deal with the attack of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was raised and looked at the magical beams of the air. Metty Crosso, who played music, did understand what he meant. The size and effectiveness of the music was as good as his embarrassment. He secretly planned the next move: "Don't crash, give me some time to organize defenses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't know, unlike before, he This time the opponent did not want to keep the artillery firepower to weaken the artillery strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Renee, Miss Her Royal Highness. Our artillery has been overheated, and it will be bombed again."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this report, the brown-haired girl touched her military cap, and the heel unconsciously began to grind on the floor of the podium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front line seems to have survived the third round of attacks, but it’s just a slap in the face. She is Seneca Weilun, who directs the Fergota army and she is responsible for every decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl sighed and asked: "How long can the Third Artillery Team shoot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Up to five minutes, Missy. With the artillery team's existing magical power, all the artillery in a quarter of an hour will enter the cooling time. Unless the frontline people are withdrawn, let them cool the barrel with ice magic..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief maid said nothing after she said a few words. She knew it was an unrealistic idea. The front line is still stuck in the same situation. As the seventh brigade of the miscellaneous army, even the heavy armies have been pulled to the front line, and they are still attacking and retreating under the attack of the Free Army. In all fairness, their combat power has improved a lot compared to the previous offensive, but it is still not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not enough. Pulling back the magician from the front line, I am afraid that the entire front will collapse immediately. At that time, what is the use of the Warlord Brigade to break through the enemy wing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the guy in Sid... I haven’t had a result in the flank for half a day? Is his superintendent brigade a waste?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the first princess of Olia Hugh Coleman, she said something she couldn’t say, and Nika nodded unconsciously, she was about to reconcile and suddenly listened. There was a very light sigh that she could only hear from her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Maggie. The great shadow politician, Maggie Yali, who still has a strong judgment, even if there is only one soul left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the intelligence of Seneca, she immediately understood the intent of this invisible companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, she felt that the first reaction was also in the bottom of my heart to blame the friendly army itself is very shameful, from any angle. She should have understood it long ago, and she can only rely on herself, no matter which country. She is not a natural noble like Oria. How can she not seize every opportunity to strengthen her reputation? Not to mention that in this situation, the result of any smashing of the line is the annihilation of the whole army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is not the time to blame them. Olia, and Miss Mara, our army needs your strength. Olia, you stay here. Hold the command flag and the artillery position for me, Mara, we will fight side by side like the last time, come back, I invite you to eat steak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡系Tightening your arm and starting to prepare spells to defend against stray bullets and scattering magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To concentrate all the reserve teams in the whole brigade, ready to invest in the front line. Contact Naserqing as soon as possible, and say that Nika von Figota intends And he was dating in his command."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the maid and the female guards all laughed, and the pressure from the frontline battle seemed to Not that big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 walked to Mara, patted her shoulder, pulled out the silver revolver inserted in the belt, pointing to the sky: Gota's warriors! Follow me and Silver Dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yanika smiled slightly and raised her chin slightly. The voice became very loud, and everyone heard: "I know. Conti tried to defeat 40,000 people in the last war with 500 people. Clad was there. The Far East relied on a thousand Western Tang soldiers to break the 70,000 iron ride. We are now there are 1,500 people, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is pleased to see This sentence has played its due role. The soldiers of the core commando broke into their fists and their eyes were filled with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who was the first to shout: "Long live the Principality of Fegota! Long live the great lady of Fegota!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers are infectious. The slogan is transmitted to the periphery layer by layer, and the shorter the pass, the more powerful it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the Principality of the Fegota! Long live Miss!" "Long live Miss Fegota!" "Fegota! Figota!" "Missy!" "Long live! Long live! Long live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People screamed wildly, as if venting dissatisfaction with the frontline. The momentum of the Free Army is one of the best, and the Seventh Brigade has stabilized its front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I only know the case of the Free Army... If he had also said something about the Emperor, he would have been."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 couldn’t help but think of the teenager who told me about the Freedom of War from the library every night. When Soledon spoke, she just listened to courtesy, but fortunately the natural memory made her remember what was not useful at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he doing now, on the other side of the Free Army? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer thinks so much, just raised her gun again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-** *——***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Nami Soleton is looking at the battlefield quietly through a telescope . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the black flag of the Governor’s brigade and plunged into the banner of the offensive force from the flank, and several lines of his own have begun to shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the advantage of the Free Army to arrange a second line of defense, barely resisting the enemy's offensive. <br /><br />############################################################################################## <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back and turned into a retreat, and the right-wing new recruits dropped their weapons and began to run around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the flag of the Figota and Brigade, and the situation was no longer a sign of a chance to turn into a victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Soledon dispelled the last bit of luck and issued an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting the battle flag!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil Anne standing behind him took the flag from his shoulder Put it down, but did not expand: "Do you come or me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door did not hesitate to reach out and take over the flagpole of the battle flag. This is the moment when he gambles on life and all his luck. This is his honor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's quite heavy." The avatar demon reminded me kindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flagpole is really heavy, but barely able to catch it. Both hands tremble uncontrollably. As he envied the powerful power of the incarnation of the demon, he inserted the flagpole into the ground and shook his wrist, letting go of the rope that tied the flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air that flies in the air is a red flag that is covered with a bullet hole and burned halfway. There is no eye-catching pattern on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before everyone thought that this unit with less than a thousand people was an ordinary reserve team, but when the flag was unfolded, all eyes were immediately Was attracted to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one person talked to himself and widened his eyes in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first free war, this "free flag" flew for thirty-three days over Lenny, as a symbol of the Free Army, from a The marshal passed to the next marshal. The original flag has long since decayed, but the distribution of the bullet holes above it and the broken edges left by the burning have been inherited by each of the marshal flags. The lines on the emblem of the Free Army also come from the broken edge of this flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a flag of the Free Army, nor a general command flag, but a brilliant flag that can only be used by the Marshal of the Republic. Its fluttering means the last hero of the Freedom Army, and Kyle's fox has come to this battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the face of this battle flag, I feel a little dazzled, there is a kind of illusion of the entire Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conte? Marshal Fox has been playing this fifth time since the third free war, and it is unclear who has been bitter and wicked in his life. Although it is only a banner, it is power itself, that is, hope, the backbone of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this flag rising, some officers directly shy to tears: "Because our escape, we have to force you to come out and reorganize the team." Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers may not be very clear, but the officers know that using the total reserve team to reorganize the defeat is a dangerous decision. Once the squad has broken through the square, the spears and muskets will completely lose their power and the chain of command will be completely broken. For these people... The marshal actually put his last battle flag! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum of the Freedom Army’s retreat stopped. The officers stopped and mourned their weakness. More than one person stood up, and the shouts of "taking me as the center!" came one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Free Army, which just had to collapse completely, actually strengthened its spirit and reorganized the queue in the encouragement of this banner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few broken companies have seen the flag in the distance, the subconscious stopped their steps, turned around and launched suicide against the advancing emperor. The counter-attack, who used his life to escape, won time. The soldiers who had lost their weapons in the panic also slowed down and began to look forward to finding some weapons to re-enter the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which officer does not expect to have his own banner in private? Which officer does not want to be the true master of this banner? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door shook his head and stopped admiring the desperate heroes. He quietly put away unrealistic fantasies, and living is the most important thing. And to survive on the battlefield, there is always one way: kill all the enemies who are trying to kill you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clasped the flagpole and began to order the order that was prepared and recorded in the Sorcerer’s Stone: “Revolve around this side of the flag and reorganize! After the banner side is reorganized!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, without his order, the soldiers will start to reorganize this banner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Army soldiers who had retreated from the front line gasped and stopped, looking at the emergency deployment of the reserve team’s headquarters officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers who retired were mostly empty or holding muskets that could not be used. Even the officers had many guys who lost their swords and pistols. Some extreme guys even threw their armed bands and ranks with potions and spell materials. But in this marshal, even a coward will be inspired by a few courage to re-tighten his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, they will see the person who will give orders to them. Various new and old muskets, gun spears, big swords, and big shields piled up on the ground, stacked on the side of this guy, sealed the way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report your rank and your troops! Regroup the team by team and origin! All the reorganizations, repeat, all the reorganization! This is the Marshal The order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeated orders of people are from the mouth of a staff officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers saw that the young captain stood alone under the flag of the battle, and one person held the marshal flag. On his shoulder is the rank of the captain, the arm is the identification of the General Staff, the chest is full of medals and battle chapters, standing on the small slope of the flag, just like he is participating in the victory parade same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is undeniable that this hand is very effective against the defeat. Seeing the Marshal flag and seeing the officers who did not take off the full set of identification marks, the panic in their hearts gradually eased. Yes, it seems that the officer has not died yet. The marshal is also very confident. Why do we have to escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put the wounded soldier! The person whose weapon is lost or damaged is here to receive a new one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This flag, this costume, this conspicuous position, standing in this posture, he is simply demonstrating to the enemy commanders. Demonstrate to Sid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The final reserve team of the enemy team, the Fygota Brigade has moved! In 30 minutes, we will fight back! Rest now!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the door screamed exhaustedly, and all his magic officers, commanding officers, temporary officers, noncommissioned officers and veterans repeated his orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that every minute of the total collapse of the army is important, and whoever wins can win. If the chasing troops of the emperor first come in, then all the people will die on this land; if they first reorganize the defeated soldiers, they may even regain this lost victory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that the enemy did not make a sudden assault, but stopped at two hundred meters, allowing the magicians, sniper musketeers and artillery of both sides. Perform a long-range shot that will not cause too much casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle left wing of the enemy, that is, in the direction of his center right, the two command flags are put together: the Fegota and the Ministry of Security . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you see each other's stay?" Although he knew that he was not Anne, but the incarnation of the demon that Anne summoned, Nara had asked this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature with beautiful girl looks shrug: "If from the perspective of demonic strategy... the interpretation of this behavior is 'they are confident that they can pinch Break our necks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curiosity of Naimen has recurred: "If there is a chance, can you discuss the issue of demonic strategy?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not very good at it, you can find my caller. When I negotiated, I found that she had relevant knowledge in her mind, but she refused to use those. To pay the bill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the opposite array of emperors, the two commanders are also talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time our security department owes you a big lady." Sid cleaned the blood on his right arm. Chatting with the newly arrived Monica, "The Security Department will definitely return it in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinica did not show his anxiety on the expression or In the tone: "Hello, do you think we should continue to attack? If the Freedom Army reorganizes the team, we will have to face a fierce battle again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Before that... they should be the ones who are taking advantage of the strategic advantage, right? Our follow-up troops were intercepted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Of course, I know the current situation, "I was intercepted by their high-ranking mages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid pointed to the Marshal flag in the distance:" However, if this is true, why is Fox still fighting so hard? From the banner point of view, this is the last reserve team of the other party. If it is my command, it will Hold the camp and hold it until the battle is dragged into the street fighting stage. Blenheim’s Free Army is of course superior, they can return after the victory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;黛妮卡愣住. "I guess, you don't want to say, 'Our troops are not being held by them. This is the strategy of the priest's opponents?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This joke is good." Sid smiled. "Of course, there is a possibility. Klad's army has been wiped out by the Figotas. They know that they have no backups and they will fight to death. Do you believe that? Missy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Clade’s army is so good, we should have won this war." Renee thought, "That If they know that the South Line can't drag our army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
