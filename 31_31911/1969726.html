This encyclopedia cannot guarantee its effects or possible harm. ]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article introduces the broad religion of the Taiping Road. For one of the Taoist sects known as "Tai Ping" by some Koman people, see "Tai Ping Jiao (Yellow Turban)". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Pingjiao is a way of creating the world (also known as avenue, heaven, right path, truth, and Taoism on different occasions), with Tao Te Ching And related Ecclesiastes are monotheistic religions taught. In the Eastern Han Dynasty Emperor (standard calendar 1st century), the giant deer originated in the Eastern Han Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In theology, monotheism believes that there is only one god. The monotheism that currently exists is mainly Taoist teaching, including Taoism, Tianshi, Taiping, and the only Helios (mainstream) influenced by them. Compared with monotheism, polytheism and pantheism believe that there are more than one god in the world or everything in the world is God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is generally believed that the germination of monotheism was founded by Li Er before the westbound, and perfected during the period of Zhangling Datianshi to Zhangjiao Datianshi. Become a universal religion with mature church organizations and teachings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tao Te Ching was regarded by the Taipings as the creation of the Taoist god "Tao" word by word to his spokesperson Laozi (Li Er). The name of Tao (Tao) comes from the first chapter of Tao Te Ching, "Tao Dao Dao, very Tao; name can be named, very famous.", meaning "you can use the Tao as the name of 'dao' (meaning the true god) But this is actually not his real name; if we give the name 'dao' (the true god), the name cannot describe the power of the Tao."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Taoists think that this sentence also implies the meaning of the name “not available” (the true God). They often use “day” instead of the name of “dao”, such as the creed taught in the yellow towel (Cangtian has Death, Huang Tianzheng, old in the Jiazi, the world of Daji) can see this usage. Some basic sects believe that Laozi himself is also one of the incarnations of the Tao, and he is called the moral sacred, and constitutes the true God called "Tao" in the form of the Trinity. [Disputed]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of the Taoist and the self-cultivators are also derived from this root, meaning "the person who learns the will of the Tao." The Taoist faith is unique and unparalleled "right way"; the sole purpose of life is to carry out the "righteous" will; the Tao sent a number of spokespersons to human beings, the greatest of which is the Laozi (Lee) who spread the Tao Te Ching, but There are also many more important spokespersons, such as Zhang Ling, Zhang Jiao, Zhang Zai and so on. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some religious scholars believe that such teachings have greatly expanded the inclusiveness of Taipingism, and that modern Taiping and emerging Pan Taoism have become supervised by the Orthodox Church. The first major religion on the church, such as the Protestant Protestant Church and the One Sun God. [Dispute, source request]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earliest Taiping religion has only one church, but in the historical process of Taiping religion, it has divided into many factions, mainly Taoism, yellow towel Teaching, cross-channel teaching, Tianshi teaching, and other less influential factions. The term "Tai Ping" or "Taoism" is often used as the general term for the entire Taoist system. "Taomin" and "cultivator" are often used as the names of all Taoists. The "Tai Ping" or "Yellow Turban" of the Koman language sometimes refers to the general name of Taiping and Hengqu, which is a peculiar phenomenon of the current Koman language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Ping can refer to the content of Taoist faith, or the sum of all Taoist churches, or the sum of all Taoists. These three can not be completely separated but have certain differences. If they can be clearly identified during use, some unnecessary arguments can be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1Classic and Doctrine<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2The History of Taiping Education<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3Sects<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4圣城<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 important people<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 References <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classic<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic classic of Taiping is Taoist, by Tao Te Ching and the vast The composition of the Taoist Collection, before and after writing and finishing time spans about 2000 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tao Te Ching was compiled in the Spring and Autumn Period formed by the Eastern Empire. According to legend, the author is Laozi (Li Er, Lao Tzu, Moral Tian Zun). According to the records of the Eastern historian, Laozi went out of the letter and was ordered to stay in Yin Xi, leaving the five thousand words "Tao Jing" to ride the green cow. His thoughts have a great influence on another important Eastern ideology, Confucianism. The original Confucian, Taoist, and Yinyang ideas together constitute the theoretical core of "Dongyi Magic." [Disputed]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Ping’s classic "Lao Zi Hu Jing" thinks that Laozi and Yin Xi passed through the later Xitang area and finally arrived at Murrayman. The island left the most primitive Taoist thoughts in the local area. Therefore, Zhang Jiao brought the Taiping Jing to this area to quickly convert the local barbarian to the right path. The new sect of the New World, "Fuzhenzheng", believes that Laozi has reached the New World after crossing the inexhaustible ocean and taught the local barbarians the true meaning of "Tao", but most orthodox factions believe that the navigation technology and magic technology at that time I can't live through the endless ocean. [Source Request]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unique and Creation: Taiping believes that "Changed three times, thus creating everything in the world." In the Taiping religion, the number three is sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trinity: Most Taiping believers believe that the only ones are Yuqing, Shangqing and Taiqing, namely Sanqing. The master of Yuqing is Yuanshi Tianzun, the master of the Qing Dynasty is Lingbao Tianzun, and the Lord of Taiqing is the moral Tianzun (Tai Shang Laojun, Laozi). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redemption and Doomsday: Taiping believes that the present world (Cangtian) will eventually end and replace it with the next life (Yellow). In a certain year (a specific time or a symbolic time is controversial), all the people in the world will be judged according to their faith in the Tao and the execution of Germany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Taiping Catholic Theology believes that since Laozi (Li Er) preached the message of the right way, all the sages, sages and celestial beings are propping the same message. . The Taiping scriptures refer to traditional Taoists and celestialists as “the sects” to distinguish these religions from Confucianism, Buddhism, and Western polytheism. They think that Li Er is the embodiment of Dao Shen, and Zhang Ling, who established the church, is the first Tianshi. The mainstream and the Hengshui faction believe that only the surname Zhang can be the master of heaven and the teacher, and the Oriental Tianshi and the New World do not agree with this view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 11th century, Zhang Zai (Zhang Hengqu) introduced science to reform, which is also the first religious reform in history, than the 15th century religion of the Orthodox Church The reform was more than four hundred years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symbol of Taiping religion is the Taiji diagram. The mainstream school advocates the yellow headscarf that represents the final judgment, so it is often called the yellow towel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;天书<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also known as the Heavenly Book. A phonetic text widely used in the territory of the yellow towel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designed by the 22nd Teacher Zhang Xu personally. Originally used to meet the writing needs of most non-Han Taoists under the rule, and later passed through all the Taoists outside the cultural class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because most sects ban character painting, a large number of artists of all ages have poured passion into the art of calligraphy, making Tianshu rich in artistic variations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pinyin text, the Bible can be used by various Taoists to spell their own language (and will also increase or decrease the letter as the voice changes), but The classical celestial book, which is the standard ethical standard, has become a bridge for the Taoist communication between the two languages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, the Taiping religion was a repressed and persecuted religion in the Eastern Empire. As a result, a large-scale yellow towel uprising broke out. In the third generation of the Zhang Lu period, the Yellow Turban Uprising, which was enshrined in the Eastern Han Empire, merged. In the name of "the world is peaceful", a unified Taiping Church was established, with Zhang Jiao as the ruling party and Zhang Lu as the teacher. This righteousness essentially destroyed the Han Empire and continued to plague the successor regimes of the Wei and Jin who inherited its political power. It was not until the split of the East and West churches during the Qian Qian period that this problem was initially resolved. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the end of the second century of the standard calendar, the Taiping religion spread the Eastern Empire and reached today’s West Tang, Murray, Jiaonan, Weizhou and other places. The farthest reaches the territory of the Elven Empire. At the height of the elf empire, the introduction of monotheistic theory had a great influence on the Church of the Sun God. The theory of the "right way" and "church" also greatly influenced the development of the underground churches at that time. Evolution. It is generally believed that the "covenant" thinking of the orthodox and the Dagong Church and the perfect bishop/bishop system come from the organizational structure of the "right way" and "canal" and "square" of the Taiping Taoist church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the Taiping Church is a religious system of political and religious unity. In the 10 years of Zhangjiao’s military training, this “Peaceful State” already has nearly one-half of the Eastern Empire, and the entire Western Region and part of the South. But the fact that this polity has two sects innately led to the failure of the uprising. Zhang Lu was defeated by Liu Bei, the famous empire of the Eastern Empire, and led the Hanzhong Army to surrender Cao Cao; Zhang Jiao, who led the main army to return, died in the west of the Guanguan Pass, and the Taiping Taoist forces withdrew from the Eastern Empire, and their forces shifted to Murray in the future. Manchu. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Zhang Liang’s death, many civil wars broke out in the Taiping Taoist countries until Sun En and Lu Xun established a stable Taiping Taoist system. During this period, although the Taiping Civil War continued, its beliefs and power maps continued to spread to the surrounding areas, and brought a general order to the chaotic and long-established Murrayman Islands and the peninsula, and established a brilliant Taiping. Tao civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disputes between the churches of the East Zhang Lu-Ge Xuan-Xu Xun were intermittent, and finally the differences reached the peak when Qian Qianzhi mastered the Eastern Tianshi School. Qi Qianzhi reached a consensus with the imperial court at that time, ending the Taiping Tao uprising that lasted for more than two hundred years, transforming the Eastern Church into a religious organization under the imperial power, but it also led to the complete division of the Eastern and Western Taiping. Since then, the Eastern Taiping Church has been generally called "Tianshi", which is different from the mainstream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard calendar 7th century, the Tang Empire was established, its royal family is Li, and the same ancestor of the Taiping religion (Li Er), the Taiping religion became the Tang Empire , legalized with the Chang'an Order. The Taoists regard this political achievement as a victory of the Tao. Taiping teaches into the golden age. From the Ridge Mountains and the east of the Qianlong Sea, all of them are under the radiation of Taiping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this period, the Taoist people continued to expand through the use of force and peaceful missions. The trade route of Taipingism also extended to Interlake, Pazhou, and Spice Islands. And established a second mission center in the later Western Tang Dynasty. The golden age created new developments in law, philosophy, and religion. The main Daoist collections were compiled and compiled in the Tang Xuanzong period (the “Kaiyuan Daozang”), and most of them continued to the modern main monastic gates, such as Maoshan, Shenque, Kunlun, and Lushan, which were also founded in this golden age. At this time, the Elf Empire and the first dynasty of the Holy Coman Empire have collapsed. The Western world has fallen into a dark age. A large number of priests, scholars, and magicians have taken refuge in the Taiping World. Cultural exchanges have brought unprecedented prosperity. Qingniu, Xiping Both the government and Changan have become world-class metropolises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the good times are not long, the standard calendar began in the ninth century, with the civil war and de facto division of the Tang Empire, the warlords everywhere, the Eastern Empire was caught in war and recession, The barbarians on the border and the barbarian army being recruited will be rampant in the empire, and the barbaric regimes at the border will be established one by one, and the internal ambitions will come one after another. The education and legitimacy of the Taiping religion was seriously challenged by the decline of the Eastern Empire. During this period, the Taiping religion repeatedly organized the guardian army to protect the Holy Land and paid a great price. This has caused the pace of Taiping's expansion to the west to stop. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the rebuilding of the Holy Empire in the eleventh century, the emperor of the empire launched a series of wars of the Southern Expedition to counter the occupation of the southern territory of the Empire by the Taiping Road. The initial Nanzheng was very successful. The Empire established a series of Principality and Houguo on the East Intres, the Xiankti Peninsula, Qianlong Island, and even the Hu Island and the Murrayman Peninsula. It was possible for the original empire to completely collect the southern islands as territories, but their achievements were once again conquered by the later Taiping religious reform leader Zhang Zai and his successors. Zhang Zai’s disciple Han Gang moved the capital of the Taiping Taoist country to the Taiping Mansion on Qianlong Island as a center and confronted the Holy Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 12th century, during the reign of Fang La, the countries of the Taiping Road once turned their attention back to the East. But in this historical period known as the "black tide", the entire Tang Empire and all its internal vassal states, as well as the nearby civilized barbarian countries, were almost completely swept away by the unprecedented powerful black invaders, the undead iron hoof. Stepping through the Green Bull House, only Taiping and Xiping House survived. Lu Yun came to power to form a great alliance against the plague of the undead, and eventually defeated them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil war of the Holy Coman Empire brought a new type of religion called "Protestantism" and a new regime called the "Republic of the Union". This regime broke out with a powerful fighting power that was incomparable by the decaying sacred empire. It not only seized the East Intres, but also opened up the entire sea route through the East and West in 50 years, and its tentacles reached the mainland of the Eastern Empire. A series of failures have caused Taiping to lose control of Muleiman and the Western Tang Dynasty. A series of medium-sized regimes have appeared on the land of the Qianlong Islands and the Murrayman Peninsula. There are four or five powerful rulings that control the land and each believes in different denominations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The closest to the secularist Taiping religion in the future is the Xitang regime centered on Xiping Prefecture, which was the predecessor of the Far East Republic. At about the same time, in the New World's Hua Chao East China Sea, the Taoist priests established their own Taiping religion in Yanzhou. This part of the Taoist will be called "new heresy" in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sects<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all major religions, the Taiping religion is also full of sects, these sects The nature of religious beliefs is the same, but there are obvious differences in theology and law. The Tianshi School and the Yellow Towel School are the most basic divisions. The Hengshui School is considered a mysticism of Taipingism and represents the combination of Confucianism and Taipingism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Taoism: The original Taoism was the original Taoism before Zhang Ling and Zhang Lu reform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow towel school: The yellow towel school is led by the great Tianshi Zhang Jiao, after the Western Expedition arrived in Murrayman to establish the mainstream faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tianshi School: The Tianshi School is a faction established by Zhang Lu and his successors who remained in the Eastern Empire. The forces are mainly in the Eastern Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hengshou School: The Hengshui School was established by Zhang Zai, and Zhang Sanfeng’s perfect post-reformation faction advocated Qi Xue and the integration of the three religions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic faction: The basics believe that only moral ethics is the sole foundation of Taiping Road, and does not recognize the works of Tianshi later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole truth (heresy): The forces of the whole truth are mainly in the New World. They think that Laozi’s westbound reaches the New World, and the New World’s monks can also become heavens. division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luoyang--existing a ceremonial monument, it is said that Laozi was a member of the Taishiguan period.

All Taiping and Pan Taoism recognize that Laozi is the spokesperson of the Tao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenzi, the disciple of Laozi, stayed in the Eastern Empire.

There is a lot of controversy about whether this person exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang Heng--The legend is the son of Zhangling. He used the five buckets of rice as a symbol of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhang Lu - claiming to be the son of Zhang Heng, the third generation of Heavenly Master. At the first Hanzhong Zhengdao meeting, the position of the teacher of the Tianshi Church was passed to Zhangjiao, and the Taiping Jiaoguo regime centered on Hanzhong, Lianglan and the Western Region was established. Later, he was smashed by Liu Bei regime, and the remaining part of the Tianshi Church surrendered to Cao Cao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ge Xuan--After the death of Zhang Lu, the Lingbao School was established, and the Tianshi Church, which was left inside the Eastern Empire, was regarded as the four major days alongside Zhang Ling.
