			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unremarkable teenager leaned on the doorpost of the sheet metal, half-closed his eyes, counting the number of women passing by in front of him to calculate the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young girls and ladies went out on the "pure gold" steps, and everyone looked at him. Soledun felt a little uncomfortable and began to concentrate on the spirit of relaxation - the basic training of concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I haven’t been honed for a long time. Probably when the teenager’s eyes just started to feel numb to the beauty, the brown-haired girl with the ponytail appeared outside the door of pure gold. As far as the standards of women are concerned, the speed is already very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry to keep you waiting, Soledoon. Is there something urgent?" Renee; Lopez now uses the words very elegant and polite, completely In line with her identity as a general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In other words, she is very different from her usual, Soleton thought. Is it because there are friends in the neighborhood? Speaking of the buddies of 黛nica...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager turned his eyes to the girl behind the childhood. Sure enough, he did not expect it... It was the woman who held it. He quietly turned his gaze back to 黛妮卡, deliberately ignoring the existence of another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I brought a good news." He smiled and said to Yanika, "St. Grace's Welfare Institute does not have to be relocated!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this news, the girl’s face immediately smiled again: “Is the nun successfully convinced the bishop? It’s great!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton corrected: "Exactly, it is not convincing, but spending money to buy it. Later, the welfare home is the common industry of teachers and nuns."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 was also taken aback: "Buy it? Was the teacher so rich? How much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 80,000 pounds, because the business is good recently. We want to celebrate tonight, so go back soon.” Soledon glanced at the squatting woman next to him and swallowed the words of “pure gold” that he had prepared to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows very well that under the gentle and beautiful face of the blonde girl, there is a tyrannosaurus that will turn his face at any time. It’s not like barbaric like 黛卡, but it’s really unscrupulous... Is it dangerous? Jenny can't just put the dagger on someone else's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's really to thank you, Annie. With all your help, we can avoid the disaster." Unfortunately, I don't understand the situation. Renee can't understand his intentions at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're welcome...but someone seems to want to avoid and ignore my existence." Anne; Seifer smiled meaningfully. However, her next sentence made the teenager feel frustrated by self-esteem: "Say it... What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Sole Dun." The teenager who did not have a sense of existence added a tone to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Complete, is this our third conversation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in juvenile In the eyes, her gaze is like a knife - straight through his thoughts. Indeed, although the two stores are close, the two have only talked three times. Soledon has been careful to avoid her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton quietly removed his gaze and stumbled: "Oh... maybe, I have no impression."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a surprise to Seneca: “I have known each other for so long. Have you only talked to her three times? Anne and Bonnie often go to our welfare home to play... Are you not there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man replied reluctantly: "About the trick of fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Indeed - it is the fate - the trick--".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne’s voice is prolonged, and Soledon notices the ironic look in her eyes . No... not only irony, but more complicated things, just like when he saw her for the second time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl in front of her seems to have a mature gaze that is not consistent with her age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he looked at her, she was watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne; Sefer looked at the teenager in front of him and mobilized distant memories. It was originally a face that was hard to remember, and it was a long time since I had not seen it. However, she still remembers the bullet that was specifically hit on the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, how old are you this year? In the same year as 黛妮卡?" Annie thought about it, still asked. She wants to confirm it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, what's wrong?" Soledon replied a little strangely, wondering why she asked this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is 18 years old." She thoughtfully looked at him with a penetrating green eyeliner - no matter how you look, Jenny Card; Lopez's childhood is also a humble, low-key, lack of unforgettable characteristics of the teenager. Anne can see that although these two people are not as glue-like as in the love story, they are not uninhibited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It shouldn't be possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, she finally shook her head and laughed Laughter, denied his unnecessary guess. She turned around indifferently and walked to the store: "Forget it, I won't trouble you, hurry back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See you tomorrow Annie! Don't forget the two sets of underwear I ordered!" The voice of Renee came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure." Annie smiled back. "And, don't run around tonight! Two people stay at home." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the content of the words sounds frivolous, her intentions are very serious and serious. Anne; Sefer hopes that her friends in this era can escape the flames of the coup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie! What are you talking about! I am not the kind of relationship with him!" When she heard Annie's words, Yanika's face was red. She picked up a small stone from the ground and threw it at Anne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl’s head was hit, turned her head, and spit on her tongue and spit out her tongue and hid in the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make trouble, let's go have lunch first. How about going to the evening? I treat..." Soreton will persuade Yanika It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching the pair disappear into the crowd, Anne felt that she had returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, when I was with Jane, Anne would have the illusion of returning to high school. At that time, she was always carefree, and she felt that there was endless youth to be able to sway, and there are countless futures to look forward to - just like the current one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anyway, the coup can be solved overnight, shouldn't it be dangerous?" The sister who had not carefully read the map thought so and returned to the manager's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her back, Bonnie stood up from the desk: "The accounts are finished. There are only four hours left. There are a lot of things to do before... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only four hours left? What do you mean?" Annie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to our history, before the sunset, the coup army will occupy the police headquarters and the parliament building." The brown-haired girl will collect some key information and samples. In my magic handbag, "We should start preparing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, have you secretly put the message to Clade; Lopez ?" Annie asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is for the sake of stability. After all, we don't know how much we have made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Xue Zhao" is busy at noon, but after two o'clock it is no longer busy. If it is in a more southerly republic, this time will be called "afternoon tea time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steak, five-paste, a glass of black wine." After skillfully spotting his share, Soledon handed the menu to the girl sitting opposite . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." The waiter took note of the order and left. While waiting for the food to be on the table, the teenager and the girl had a chat without a ride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you come here often? A la carte is very skilled." Soledon asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take twice with Klad." Renee answered. "What about you? You are very skilled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few times before." When it comes to this topic, Soledon subconsciously recalls the owner of the dagger and dagger on his neck. There is also the chest of the dagger owner - when I meet, I just feel embarrassed, but in retrospect, the touch behind is still good...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the youth immersed in the uniqueness of youth When I was in fantasy, the waiter was already on the plate. Two good steaks, with a slight blood color, attracted people's appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, how do you think about asking me to eat today?" Renee took the knife and tried to saw the steak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because today the teacher is kind, earned some extra money." Five-cooked steak, which is basically raw, can taste the unique beef. Tasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We both seem to have been eating out for a long time. Last time it seems to be the year before?" Renee recalled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we were mixing in the streets of Lenni, we used to eat together..." Soledon ate the steak and wiped his mouth. Until we got back to the teacher, ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The word '捡' is used very well, he was completely like a liar... Who knows He turned out to be a mage who fled from the north."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are six years in a blink of an eye..." Soledon tasted the wine and sighed. "I was thinking, should I be able to open the business soon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sentence, I have a smile on my voice: "This is... ...magic doesn't just depend on talent. As long as you work hard, you can always improve your own realm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not talking about magic, but clothing store. I am I wonder if I can also be a tailor or a designer... The way of magic, I am dying. Maybe I really don’t have talent.” The boy gently shook his hand in the glass, and the ice hit the cup. , a slight "beep" sound. He did not say it later: if he does not open his business, he will not be able to stand on his own feet. If he can't stand on his own, he won't have the opportunity to propose to the daughter of the general...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I say that?" Renee retorted, "As long as you work hard , you will be rewarded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yawn..." "Lazy Soledon" shook his head. "I have seen my magic." The end of the road. It’s been six years in a blink of an eye. Magic is like music, painting, writing, and people who work hard are everywhere, but they can hardly get paid. I don’t want to go on.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡's face is cold: "You want me to eat today, do you want to say these sorrowful words?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no." Soledon hurriedly changed the subject. "Do you want something else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you really have no money, Next time I go to Zacarde, I will check out, go home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of 黛妮卡 are out of heart, but listen Dayton ears, but no different from tactful blame - blame the most ruthless than reveal the truth. He is indeed poor, lazy, and has no talent. He can't be compared with the general's financial situation... The teenager is bitterly drinking the black label in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The waiter, checkout..." He raised his hand and bounced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss, a royal black mark!" The table next to him cut off the waiter he called. The teenager frowned and turned his head. He wanted to emphasize that he would come first and then - just as he saw the table, the thought was dispelled by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that it’s a team of adventurers. They ordered more dishes than he had ordered, and they were more luxurious, with a 250-pound Royal Black Mark on the table. The headed person looks like a young knight, wearing a well-made lock, and the pattern is undoubtedly a blessing of magic. The female companion beside him is a very beautiful brunette, and her costume can tell the believers of Musika. The team also includes a sturdy middle-aged man, possibly a warrior; the last one is a young man no more than twenty years old with a dagger at his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is really a dangerous job, otherwise it would be a good way for the magician. The teenager who pursues stability has never included this profession in his own considerations - after all, there are few well-known and status-adventurers in the entire civilized world. Most of the magician adventurers lost their lives in their first adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Checkout." He slouched and again slammed his fingers, paid off the £16 meal, and walked out the door with 黛妮卡. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go home!" The girl stretched out. "Don't you go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You go back first," Soledon said. "I have to buy something to eat and celebrate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to catch On the celebration!" Renee said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry." Soledon counted the last few gold coins in the pocket and answered with a hard scalp. I have to go to the cheapest market, I am afraid I have to wait until the break... he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn’t know was that this was the last side he and 黛nica; Lopez saw...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......This is just what it should be. Because, there are butterflies that are flapping their wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supreme Superintendent Jemmett; Rudel is always upset. Uneasy for no reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands to reason that today is a very calm day. No major cases have occurred, and no thorny issues such as strikes or marches have taken place. On such a peaceful day, the highest policeman felt uneasy from the bottom of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a bunch of hay from the desk, devoutly held it in his hand and began to recite the spell. He wants to ask the gods he believes in, and he can explain his uneasy metaphor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the power of the spell, the hay began to move slowly and eventually formed four strange figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rudel looked at the past one by one, staring nervously at the graphics made up of the sacred haystacks and trying to figure out what it meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first word is...the army. The army represents repression and domination, and it appears in the first place to symbolize the alternation of power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second word is ... action. Action represents determination and will, and appears in the second place to represent a major event."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The third word is...change. Change represents the beginning of a new era or a very important turning point..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fourth word It is ... dangerous. Danger represents death and war..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? Army, action, change, danger. What do these four gods tell me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jermit; Rudel thought nervously, sweating on his head. In any case, this is certainly not a good metaphor. coup? Military conspiracy? Northern invasion? Civil revolution? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Being prepared is always better than not prepared", this is one of the creeds he believes. The highest policeman stood up from the desk and pulled the bell, wanting to call the secretary. He is determined to have all police forces in a state of alert - even if he is accountable by the parliament, he must be prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No response. The highest policeman was a little angry, pressed again, and vowed to give this damn secretary a good look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the bell slammed and slammed three times. With the bell, the door opened quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudel’s secretary appeared at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it so slow!" The highest policeman asked angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry... someone wants to see you, sir." The secretary replied stutteringly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How not to report?! What are you doing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
