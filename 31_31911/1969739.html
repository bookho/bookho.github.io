			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inscription: The dandelion war and purple pipa in the second part of the rumor number is now in the pit... I will fill it later. (Is it...) There may be spoilers... In case there is no filling, look at this right as a synopsis of the story...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the season description: In most North temperate civilizations, there are two combat seasons a year: spring and autumn. Spring is from March to June, and autumn is from September to December. In the popular paper-based game in the later Freedom Army officers, it is generally two seasons of combat, marked as s (spring) and f (fall)... (å‘ƒ... Will the author make rules? Maybe...)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth century (the century of replacement)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The alliance is generally Words are believed to be able to defend peace, but in some cases, the alliance will also become a catalyst for war. Some countries will boldly launch wars because of the guarantees of other countries, and some countries will use the use of force by allies. Being dragged into the war. In the end, a small thing will evolve into a wide range of wars. To maintain peace, you must have unlimited patience and a firm will to never lose faith in diplomacy. War will never come. True peace, this history has been repeated in every history book since history. Unfortunately, the rulers will never learn the lesson.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is peace Diplomacy during the period, or diplomacy during the war, generally four Basic assumptions: 1: Power is the main role. 2: Power is the only role. 3: The ruler is a rational animal. 4: Peace is the most important interest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These four assumptions are generally always satisfied. However, in some cases, Article 3 or Article 4 will be violated for various reasons, often because the rulers are tempted by interests to lose their rationality, or they value the interests. Peace is needed. In this case, the war will change from a limited war to an infinite war, from a war that maintains the old order to a war that creates a new order. However, never - never the result of any war, such as the initiator The will is generally perfected." - "The History of Dandelion War" commented on the outbreak and intensification of the war of inheritance and the war of royal power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af309: Spring, "The only and permanent emperor" Kuras; Tiotstein collapses. There was a slight crack in the Elf Empire, which reached its highest point in all emergency meetings in the summer. Whether it is the veteran meeting, the second Taranto meeting, or the Association of Masters Associations, they are caught in a fierce quarrel and division. The governors of the 12th Road are mostly Kuras; the blood of Tiotstein, or the great aristocrat who gave the name of Tiotstein (this habit lasted into the period of the Coleman Empire), most people declared their own position on the throne Have legal requirements. In the autumn, the Governor of the Northeast Road, "Chou Blade" Gu Dai'an; Tiotstein raided the Near East Road, proclaiming the outbreak of the war of inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af310: Spring, with the surrender of the Duke of Lowellland, the main force of the Lower East Road was defeated, and Governor Nidick was hanged. Gu Dean announced that he would integrate the Upper and Lower East Roads into the Central West Road, and vowed to advance to Kulas, and quickly removed the Central South Road to form a close relationship with Kuras. The Central Third Road was shocked and formed a temporary alliance under the integration of the Governor of the Central Road, Fabio and Tiotstein. In the autumn, the first Kulas attack and defense broke out, and the battle stretched to the winter and the spring of the following year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Gu Di'an with the name of 'The Blade'; Tiotstein is a superb general, but he is not a brilliant ruler. The earliest hands-on, and the four enemies, became the common enemy of the world. By relying on the ability and command of the people, and the abundant human and material resources of the Near East, he can grow stronger than a moment, but can not go to God according to this... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af311: In the spring, Shengsen finally responded: announcing Gu Dian; Tiotstein's offense violated imperial law. The Sansen nobles stepped into the Near East, but they were attacked by Gu Daian, who was rushed back. They had to give up the Near East and return to Kinki. The "Choubla" army smashed into the road, and the war entered into the rubber. In the autumn, after the release of the Kuras, Fabio and the Governor of the Central Plains Road, Kleon; Tiotstein, Governor of the East Road, Ferrena; Tiotstein formed an alliance to join forces against the momentum Sheng Gu Dean; Tiotstein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af312: In this year, the last volume of Imperial history was completed. After leaving the last volume, the figure of the Elf nobleman and the first historian, Hiloto, disappeared into the flames of the central region; it was the end of a great era. In the autumn, the second Kulas siege war broke out, and the Clarion Army and the Eastern Allied Forces broke out in a fierce battle: the solar sail fleet that was once proud of the empire was also destroyed in this battle, after a thousand years. Never once again flew above the sky. Then the two armies entered a stalemate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Af314 years: Spring, "Chou Blade" Gu Dai'an; Tiotstein lost to the Livia River (the future Coven River). Xia, signed the "Sani Tiegana Treaty." In the treaty, the two parts of the Upper and Lower East and the Central and South Central Roads will be merged into the Central West Road, which will be under the jurisdiction of Fabio and Tiotstein; the upper part of the Near East will be returned to the Senate Senate; Central North Road and The upper and lower Far East Road merged into the Central East Road, under the jurisdiction of Kleon; Tiotstein; the Far East, the East Road (the facts have been lost) merged into the Far East Road, under the jurisdiction of Ferenna; The empire was actually divided into four parts. Autumn, temporary calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af315: Spring, Kleon; Tiotstein and Ferenna and the Duke of Lowellland in the Near East signed a treaty to invade Fabio Territory. The Fabio army built a line of defense in the front line of Kuras (DeLand)-Dilamon, and the two armies stalemate. In the autumn, the Sala Bay sea battle, the Western fleet collapsed. In the winter, the Fabio army front collapsed and retreated to the Upper East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The war in the central region basically subsided in 315. In September 315, the naval battle in Sarah Bay determined the final destiny of the Western Army. Lost the sea power, the Central West Road Governor Fabio; Tiotstein no longer has the possibility to connect his two main territories: the Nevia and Dyram. From any point of view, the Sarah Bay battle In the war of inheritance, there is also a decisive battle position..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af316: In the spring, the Far East war broke out and Ferenna began to unify the Far East. The Kleon Army was besieged by Sanitti Fegna, the capital of the Near East. The tragic siege of the city was only seen in the war of inheritance. In the fall, Fabio surrendered and was hanged in Kuras. Kleon; Tioldstein moved to Curran and called the emperor. St. Sen responded fiercely and sent Tezd; General Nedru crusade against Pseudo. The two armies Chen Bing was near Sanitti Fegna, and the battle was once again a hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...After several plunders, the most prosperous region of the empire - the Upper East Side Road that connects the local and central regions has almost become a scorched earth. Before the war of inheritance, the area was densely populated and business travel was busy; but after the war ended, the remaining population was only about 15 percent of the original population. Most of the elves fled to the mainland, and more humans fled. In the next history, the Upper East became the front line between the Sanssen and the Central regime, and has not been able to restore the glory of the Age of the Elf Empire..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af317: Sassen and Kuras reached a compromise. Kleon handed the Upper East Road to Sansen in exchange for the retreat of the local army. This symbolizes the end of the War of Inheritance: Kleon; Tiotstein was supported by the Eastern Church and won with a very small advantage in the second vote of the Taranto Conference, and became the "Emperor Emperor". He actually controlled the vast land from the Lower East to the Marginal River, accounting for about one-third of the Empire's territory. Ferrena; Tiotstein also sworn to surrender to him, and the empire regained peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af323: The second Taranto conference finally broke down after a fifteen-year marathon agenda. The East and West churches split because they could not reach a consensus, splitting into The sun god that suppresses arcaneism and the covenant Orthodox that encourages arcaneism. The division of the Eastern and Western churches led to the division of the Wizards Association, and the humans and elves quickly split into two camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af329: The Duke of Loviland, the "black hybrid" of the near-eastern Philiadir family, provoked and captured a province . The Duke of Loviland, who had no reluctance, did not counterattack, but immediately turned to Kleon for help, and the Filiardir family reluctantly retreated. This buried the seeds of the outbreak of the royal power two years later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af331: On the occasion of spring and summer, the plague hit a large area of â€‹â€‹the empire. Sadie, author of The History of Dandelion Wars; Warrens visits Curacao. Autumn, Lowellland; Feng; Bisno, under the acquiescence of Kleon, launched an attack on the Near East, the Republic of Sanctuary shocked, and the war of kingship broke out. Honglinasti once again dispatched the expeditionary army led by General Tezd; General Neder, to the evil sect who abandoned the teachings of the Presbyterian Church and the Sun God, and the Duke of Soma Fegna declared war. Kleon; the Emperor Tiotstein also issued a general convening order. In the winter, due to the failure of the main force in the field, the capital of the Near East fell again, and the eldest son and the second son of the Filiard family died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;af332: In the spring, the Sansen Expeditionary Force attacked Sanitti Fegna and failed to cut off the supply line of the Lower East Army from the south side. In response, the Emperor Klein sent a naval fleet to maintain the supply line of Sanitti Fegner, indicating his full support for the Duke. As the fleet arrived, there was the Guards of the Emperor's Guardian - this kicked off the summer battle. Autumn, due to the existence of the Dragon Knights and the great magician Lisa who invented the magic; the presence of Quillaxia, with the opportunity of being transferred to Sanitti Fegna by the main force of the Upper East Army, the expeditionary army captured the broken The unbearable city, and the trend to the south to pursue the Duke of Lowellland. Then, the main force of the Klein Army arrived in the Near East, and confronted the Expeditionary Force. Arthur, who will be called "Keman the Great" in the future; Keman, at this time, was escorting the Duke of the Duke to escape the encirclement, and spent the day sitting down in the mountains under the Duke of Lowell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
