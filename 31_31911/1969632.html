The city gate in front of the district turned to the north. Their goal is the “order and discipline” hotel in the North City. The soldiers who drove the horses to the fullest, tried their best to escape from the possible pursuit. Of course, the three defendants who were under house arrest were not happy, and the atmosphere inside the car was dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Who is the one who came to save us?" The first secretary of state who broke the silence was the plaster-like expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "I think it’s probably ours. The two people who just shot, I am afraid we are the best people in the South..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prathor replied. Recalling the magic I just saw, he can't believe it now - that's probably not the best level in the South. Those who can use this level of arcane and magical skills, I am afraid that they can be placed in a very high position within the entire empire. He felt a little pride: his motherland did not hesitate to send such a strong lineup to save him, and he was satisfied even if he failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published Gowal and smiled a bit: "It’s a brutal rescue. Are you still dying of Jules? I’m blunt, even if this save is successful, I After returning safely to Kengler, I am afraid I will not be able to sign the merger treaty you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "That doesn't matter, the emperor does not really want to merge Ruhrock After hearing the Marshal’s refusal, the Count of Rasta simply took out the card. “Your Majesty just wants a neutral buffer. As long as Ruslock remains neutral, we can have enough troops to drown Fay and Emei. We can also be your protectorate and ensure that you are not harassed by your former companions..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the story, the driving soldiers suddenly coughed up. Rasta suddenly woke up and hurriedly shut up. To his surprise, the coachman spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Cough. Thank you, you are leaking state secrets. It is not appropriate to give up hope so early. Maybe God will give you a new turn." What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing this sound, several people in the car were surprised to open their mouths, especially Chase, who was remotely controlled by Lily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "You are Jeter; Nitton? Are you all Imperial agents?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The release of "good memory, is a politician, you have talent in this area." The middle-aged pastor replied, "Have you hurry, smash the door, drift!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;released "drift...?" Rasta subconsciously repeated the words he had never heard before, closing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Hold! Surface grav" Another driver has read the spell out loud. The passengers in the car are rolling to the side, it feels like Rasta grabbed the doorknob and looked out through the window.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published him to see this huge carriage straight to the side of the third floor High buildings -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published - and climbed up!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish is just like The crossroads on the ground turned like a bend, and the carriage ran up the side of the building.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "God. You actually have this Kind of magic..." Chase looked at the scene and opened his mouth; his head slammed into the roof without warning, and fainted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Everybody, We will have a journey on the roof. Please don't be afraid.” I said, “I am the Acting Director of the Southern Bureau of the Royal Security Department.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Published in their conversation, the second carriage that had followed closely slammed into the fruit stall below the building. The Farius cavalry who was driving was looking at the wall in front of him, I don’t know what happened. What. Bezi ironed his face, took his own military cap, pushed the door out and just stepped on an orange; he angrily threw his pale blue cap on the ground.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing the group of gits, it was all cover, the real agents are here! We are fooled!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "General Betsy, please go to the nearest police station to issue a general blockade order, it should be too late. Close all the gates and monitor them! Even if their carriage can climb the wall, it is impossible to climb five! The soldiers are mobilized, and Marshal Govar must not be allowed to fall into the hands of the Imperial agents!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish Wiener; Betsy glanced at this good opponent, if any Thinking: "If you want to guarantee this, you can only use the last resort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After releasing Clade, he took a step back: "You Is it killing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French muse nodded. Clade did not hesitate, but he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "But there is a condition, you have to let me try it first. Unless they are about to escape, you can't hurt the life of the former marshal." He turned and gave the unconscious Hull to the non-commissioned officer, "Lieutenant Colonel Tedwood gave it to you. I will chase it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general released a deep breath and used a magic that didn't know what it was. The toes leaped to the roof and chased the black carriage. Betsy looked at the back of the brown-haired man, thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "You immediately went to the nearest police station to issue the highest martial law. All the soldiers returned to the army and participated in the hunt. Tell Robert to the north gate. Only he can defeat the liberation knight. Finally... go to the arsenal and transfer all three 'burst guns' out. When someone asks, all of them are blocked in my name."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After releasing the task assigned to the Guard Cavalry, he patted the dust on his body and hurried to the nearest military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "It seems that the competition between us must go to the last moment, Clade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announcement When the blood of the Supreme Court is in full swing, Anne is enjoying her lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "It’s all homemade food, just eat it. Just be your own home, okay? A young girl is also very hard to be a manager. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuns were released to persuade her with a smile, and the smile was so kind to let Anne chill on her back. She knew that the nun must have misunderstood, but she did not know how to explain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "misunderstanding will be misunderstood." The blonde girl licked her hair and thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she released her, she fell off the plate before the facade, shed tears, even slapped him in the face, and finally broke into laughter...now no matter what she said, Sister Wei Lun and Fran must not take it seriously. These adult men and women will only show their smiles and make "we understand everything." The explanation was left to Solayton and slowly went to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after knowing Naimen; Soledon’s "real" identity, she also did not want to argue... with them Let's go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Right, do you want to see the letter from Renee?" Zalt took it out of his pocket. "You should be very concerned." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announced that Anne, who knew the lie had been exposed, blushed and was embarrassed to take the letter. Only when she saw her name changed, her hand could not help but shake her hand. She searched her own memories of history and remembered a very uncomfortable woman...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released "Damn, I should have known it since. Since this Soleil Dunton is the door to the door, and that Nika will certainly not be inactive... but I didn’t expect it to be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;release just now, her earrings Lightly rang. Anne immediately stood up and suppressed the tension and asked: "Where is the toilet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published "on the corner at the end of the corridor." The nun pointed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issuing Anne Road, I walked out the door and went to the safe corner to pinch the earrings to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "What happened? Did Clade fail? Hey? Hey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting "What are they doing? Are they accidentally pinching this up? Or saying..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he hesitated, and struggled I have to go to the court; but the idea of ​​going back to eating finally has the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Abominable, Anti-Magic Array! Finished..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Pure Gold" The intelligence officer Andrew Ping was lying in the auditorium and felt his waist was broken. The magic items in his hand have long formed a circular circuit; but under the influence of the anti-magic array of emergency start, this does not make any sense. When Anne got the news from other sources, the precious time was wasted an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three red fireworks salutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most advanced warning signal for the release of these crosses was re-supply a week ago, so that the pure gold consortium made a small fortune; no one thought of these The new signal cannon will come back to use so soon. The difference is that this time added a blue star and a green star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Wow! Fireworks!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children who released the welfare home cheered. The door stood up and looked at the fireworks that bloomed in the sky not far away. The three red fireworks have nothing to do with him or her, but the blue five-star teenager vaguely remembers where he saw it. It seems to be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing Miss Miss Sefer, is the military’s emergency recall order? I used to see the list of supplies.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel recalled and replied: "Probably it. There is only one possibility in this festival."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released "Radz; Gowar was rescued from the court." Nanimen did not hesitate to judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "You are right, Soleton. This can be troublesome..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Issuing Anne worriedly biting her lips, recalling the unspeakable emergency newsletter: it was a full hour ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement of the communication was that Radz had just escaped by horse, and he should have arrived at the North Gate now. The prospect of the former marshal's escape made her frightened: at least one-third of the Free Army will unite around the city of Kengal! She does not dare to expect the other three republics to tolerate this betrayal. That would give birth to a much larger Fort.... The blood will soak through the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing - this is still without considering the emperor group. Thinking of this, the blonde girl regrets her own judgment mistakes. She hurriedly stood up and said goodbye to the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Sorry, I have to say goodbye. The army is calling me, I have to go back and report. Thank you for your kind hospitality."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "All the way, don't make an accident!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the farewell to the enthusiastic nuns, she re-appeared the Red Army Cap, put on a coat. Just about to go out, she suddenly found that the door was behind her, picking up the gunpowder bag and the bullet bag from the shoe rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announced Anne, asked strangely: "You don't have to go, Soledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Publish "Why? I am also a soldier, and I have to follow this emergency call. I am going." The teenager added the tone of the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "You are not a formal soldier yet." Annie retorted, "Your order has not yet taken effect." How can she allow him to follow? ? With him around, she can't hide her identity and ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "You shouldn’t go, Miss Sefer? That’s the call signal from the North-Central Army and the French Army, but not called red. Clothing army." Nanimen immediately cited another reason to refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "This is too dangerous! The other party is a death squad who can steal people from Lopez and Lal. You will not be qualified for this magic." Compared with them! Stay, Soledon, someone here is waiting for you to come back, no risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release (I can really - just don't want you and others to see it. I will definitely save you when you are in danger... This is too dangerous.) Anne thought secretly, thinking about what reason to use The other party stays. But the next sentence of Naimen directly hit her memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Let's go together and fight side by side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish a very ordinary sentence, But it made Anne involuntarily reconcile the figure of the young man in front with the shadow in her memory. Fight side by side...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish (Awful, this is another person in another world! Why do I think back?)<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Let's go, it has been delayed for too much time. Be careful, don't drag my hind legs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish She changed her boots and tied her shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Let's go to the recent warning point report to find out the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general command to issue the pursuit operation is located in the Eastern Police Department, not far from the west side of the Welfare Institute. Robert rushed to the North District to manage the pursuit work there, and stayed here to deal with General Betsy and Herr, who had a bandage on his right body and a plastered arm hanging from his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish "Awful, leave only two bodies? Hunt the rest of the people and torture their plans!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "How is the crowd evacuated?" "Most streets are empty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Five Walls?" Are there any people on the tower?" "The basic assignment has been completed, and all the surveillance magic arrays inside and outside the five-storey city wall have been opened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Three Walls and There are still no reports on the four-walled watchtower?” “No, everything is ok!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing “Is there any news for Governor Lopez?” “Not yet, Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a serious injury, but Hull managed to organize the entire pursuit plan very smoothly. Originally, he was going to help him manage it together, but the lieutenant colonel refused. The newly-launched Lenni defending army is his chief staff officer. As long as he still has consciousness, he will not be handed over to the friendly chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishing "Even if you can climb the roof? Here is the city I grew up... Don’t think it’s so easy to get away from it. The city 'escaped.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released Hull with his left hand on the map of Lenny, pointing the soldiers to monitor every important intersection. He couldn't find the carriage that was high and high in the city wall, but he was confident that he could capture the prisoners between the five walls. There are nearly a thousand defensive towers for monitoring purposes inside and outside the five walls of Lenni. There is one every 200 meters, which is mutually responsive to each other. It is also a fire point available during the defensive war. Inside each tower there is a magical alarm for alarms. These things are directly connected to the map in front of him. No matter where the escaped carriage is found, it can be intercepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defense of the city is not limited to this. Seven years ago, in order to defend against the possible air assaults of the empire, Lenny's magicians modeled the empire's "great sensor" to construct a detective-destroyable array that would block the sky and the earth. The Ronnie's Detective Network is erected on the outermost wall. All creatures that want to cross the magical array from outside the "door" will be detected, recorded, and enchanted, paralyzed or even killed as appropriate. Now, he has already opened the second level of "paralysis" effect. If you consider the emergency anti-caster equipment in each tower, Lenni can be called a magic city with magic defense magic. The only problem with these defense systems was the inability to cope with the melee, so no one used them during the melee on the 7th night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s costly to release such a defense, but with a myriad of large-scale magic, the Republic of the Union can barely resist the North with the magic. There are more new magic techniques in the North, but the South has more powerful economic power to put these magic into life and armaments, and the two sides maintain a delicate balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publish (plus the terrible General Lopez... Even if these agents are masters above the Platinum Emblem and pastors above the Archbishop, I am afraid there is no hope. .)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
