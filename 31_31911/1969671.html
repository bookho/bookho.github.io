Emperor **<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerial The magical light shines through the clouds, and the dripping blood on the ground soaks the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snoring of the wounded soldier, the organ sounds louder and louder. Under the guidance of the Pegasus Knight, the deadly magic of the music began to pour into the ranks of the Warlord Brigade, causing sporadic deaths and injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Sid Nass looked up and frowned at the inconspicuous. The enemy's air force operations seem to be a bit too hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of his wand bursts with black rays, piercing an enemy Pegasus knight in the air like a lightning bolt. The lieutenant in the red military uniform fell off the air with his own mount and squatted on the wall of Jena, turning it into a red pigment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the artillery of the Figota Brigade can only stop here, and the time for the start of the artillery phase is a bit lacking."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of Security’s lips swayed and secretly calculated the damage caused by the shelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Sid is standing now is the center of the battlefield, just next to the Vauban, which was abandoned by the Free Army. The first two were only for the purpose of exposing the other party's firepower distribution, and the offensive force only withdrew one-fifth of the casualties and retreated. This time, he invested in two battalions of his own two battalions and the seventh brigade, and carried out key breakthrough attacks on the scale of four battalions and two thousand people, and won this trench in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is reality, not a heroic epic. Any breach of fortifications means that the attacker has already paid a high enough price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the top of the slope and looked to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musket abandoned by the enemy was thrown at his feet, and many of the barrels were filled with bars, showing the identity of their owners. If it is not because there are too many new recruits, there should be more than twice the intensity of firepower in the vicinity of this trench, and the attacking party's body is enough to fill the trenches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are patriotic and enthusiastic people who have no chance to learn the correct methods of combat and have no chance to escape. A very small number of successful survivors will be at the heart of the next stubborn army full of veterans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of this war to the present, the Free Army has had so many officers and soldiers with combat experience, enough to make up for the amazing loss in the civil war. Perhaps, among the enemies he faces, many of them are opponents who have joined the army for only a few months but are already very stubborn...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Jena It is the battlefield chosen by Sid. Away from the heavy fortification of the two fortresses of Kengler and Lenni, no matter which side can only establish temporary fortresses, the search for farmers' stocks on the spot is enough to support a large-scale battle. He and his staff stepped on every hill near Jena, and the height of each hill was marked on the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is only a few months, we have already reached the point where we will be held in a close match. And it is not a military advantage. The battle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Sid felt a little chill. Those young citizens are quickly becoming sophisticated fighters, consuming the precious elites of the empire. There are so many veterans who have died in the scope of his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is keenly aware that Jena is also the battlefield chosen by the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this breakthrough point, a total of more than two hundred people were sacrificed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green The hair of the hair floated in front of her eyes, and a charming female voice calculated the current situation for him, and issued a warning that she deliberately slowed down: "By the way, the other party concentrated a team of firemen trying to kill you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid's eyes jumped. At the same time that the voice issued a warning, the security minister’s arm moved. His movements can't be linked to the word "fast" at all, but it makes people feel amazedly accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"铛!铛!铛!铛!铛!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp edge on the right arm is accurate The ground slammed the five sniper bullets that were fired one by one, and cut the magic lines above, so that the attached magic could not be launched. Five lead particles smashed on the back of the knife and turned into a small, wrinkled cylinder that fell weakly into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three hits are destined to miss the bullet. He didn’t take care of it at all, but prepared a fortified fireball magic in his left hand. Those few are obviously the veteran veterans of the other side, and Sid did not let them go. Unfortunately, he does not have a sufficient number of mages at hand, and these clean-up work can only be done personally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general level of magic of the Security Minister is not too high. There are five high-ranking mages and three cardinals in the main force of the Light. De, he can command these people mainly because he is the imperial minister, the deputy commander of the legion, and there are some secret magic tricks that others can't...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There are four left now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid couldn't help but think of Victor von Curick who died in front of him. This ominous association divides his heart and makes the flames gather more slowly. The eunuch opposite the embarrassed officer took the time and removed the sniper squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Responsively fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid’s mouth twitched, still put that The fireball was thrown out. The enemy soldiers behind the wall fell down, and the magical flame burned for a while near the wooden wall, but soon disappeared because there were no more combustibles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, it’s the responsibility of others, not paying attention to their assembly in time. Does the right hand hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female voice pretended to be concerned and asked, but there was a taunt in the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid shook his head and returned to the slope: "If steel can feel pain, it is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only he knows that his non-existent right hand is really in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to boost morale and cause fears of the enemy and oneself, Sid did reject the treatment of the archbishop who came to the front line and turned his bones into combat. The sharp edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing this, the pain is still endless, just like there is a real arm there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific name of this phenomenon is called "phantom limb", one of the senior mage's occupational diseases. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era when the Elven Empire still existed or the first Coleman Empire was glory, the great magicians were arrogant with great magic. This phenomenon is often mentioned in the literature left by these sages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sages who became lichs, minds, and immortals repeatedly recorded this inhuman suffering. Those who were sacrificed as a cost of spells, those who disappeared in alchemy and taboo magic experiments, those who had been abandoned, and the body, seemed to exist in general, often with pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, in this world, thinking determines matter, and will determines power. Sometimes, the uncontrolled will will exceed the material, and the things that do not exist will return pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the sacrifices that must be paid for the path of the great mentor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the conscience that no longer exists. The Royal Security Department does not need conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I know that my conscience does not exist, is it still painful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The woman, Maggie, and the voice of Veri is full of malice. Her slender fingers were playing with the blade at the end of Sid's right arm. The phantom cut from the knife and was cut into two segments by the blade. Of course, there was no bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has controlled countless souls, but it is rarely so useful and difficult to control. As a few innovative magicians, Maggie Vaughan is proficient in spiritual magic and can even maintain a certain degree of independence. Unlike the phantoms and undeads used in pure combat, she and his mode of thinking are quite close. Under the force of magic, the cooperation between the two sides is very smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the cost, Sid defaulted to her independence: he needed a staff with independent judgment, not a machine to execute orders. As long as the task can be completed, he does not care about attitudes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, please ask my conscience lady to calculate how many people the striker has to pay to break into this simple cement-wood hybrid castle."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A chest wall, an exposed horned horn, a fort defense line. In the absence of this mage power, about 300 people can spread out to the back line The bloody road." Maggie shrugged. "If you don't count the enemy who is preparing to fight back from the flanks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hundred people. "The Minister took a step forward. "The problem is just that we don't know how firm the will of this counterattack will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy has already attacked ready. The lead bolt passed over the right shoulder and passed through with Sid's defensive magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of enemies is quite large, and the young soldiers who were repulsed from the trench line were reorganized by the staff near the second chest wall, panting, tight Holding the guns that were received again, they were ready to launch a counterattack against the artillery brigades of the Governors and the Figota. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Army’s slanting fingers constitute a signature line of the Marshal’s signature slash line, with a serious focus on the direction of the Figo Tower. Their plan is obvious, knocking out the artillery and cavalry of the emperor while defending the main force of the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it. Flag bearer, organize follow-up troops!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid, sigh, look back Go to the command flag of your own military brigade. However, the standard bearer could not get close and still stayed behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The firepower of the Free Army is all concentrated near the command flag, and the flag cannot be close." Maggie said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell them, if the soldier can't bring my command flag up, let the eunuch bring it. If the eunuch can't bring it, let the school official take it. The firepower on the opposite side is not strong enough to ask us to send the officer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Minister waved his hand and summoned a striking red light to point to the enemy The direction in which the army gathered. As his fingers bounced, the red light shone in the air, turning into an order in the eyes of the officers of the Superintendent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supervisor brigade, go forward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not enough Masters, but there is no way. The Security Minister reminded himself that all the high-ranking spellcasters gathered in the hilly areas of the South to prepare for the survival of the Imperial Main Legion and the enemy's high-level casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also believes that his troops can use training and courage to make up for the lack of sufficient magic support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Total attack command! Supervisor brigade, advance! Retreat to kill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One shoulder The black-striped black officer shouted and tried to reorganize the team and break through the enemy's defense from another angle in accordance with the red light command. On this front, Sid puts most of his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the liaison officer of the Superintendent Brigade ran to the stage of Yanika and conveyed the order to the Princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seneca Lopez just shrugged and said that her artillery had already been ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fertaga's artillery received the signal of the attack. Valuable shells filled with fuel and acid were removed and stuffed into the cannon at the last minute. The female gunners used their wands to draw a spell on the surface of the gun, and the observer read the opposite range according to the ruler. The speed of these magical cannonballs will be higher than those of the previous ones, and it will be more difficult to be intercepted by the other party's "slaughter dragon melody". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So will they stop attacking?" an artillery officer next to Yanika said to himself, "All our firepower has been put in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't think so. If they are an army that can be repulsed like this, we have already won this battle." Renee stuck subconsciously holding her pistol. "Before this trench, Blood will flow all over the place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recruits of the Free Army began to waver, but the veterans who stood in the forefront and the rear of the ranks were not. In Kengal, in Fort Stil, in Lenny, these veterans experienced blood and artillery. They won't stop, they won't shoot, but they will rush into the opponent's trench with a gun. They know how to maximize their hit rate: get closer and finally shoot. Whether it is possible to risk the psychological pressure of the first shot to reach the distance of the close war is the difference between the recruits and the veterans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, facing Sid’s forces, the free army relied on the chest wall and the fort wall to defend. The ratio of recruits and veterans on this front is one to one. The defense is not only strong but also flexible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called flexible meaning is that after the Warlord Brigade breaks through a point, these people will not shoot or throw away their weapons, but in the command of the chief officer. Under the formation of small units, with a determined counterattack to destroy the enemy before expanding the gap. In the face of the Imperial soldiers who have at least five years of combat experience, these people do not fall at least on the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One side of the flag of the Governor’s brigade retreats, falls down, and erects again. Some flags even fell on the Freedom Army’s line of defense and never stood up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the enemy array, a sense of powerlessness passed through the body of Sid Nath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent has done his best, but there is still no way to defeat this unit. Both the number and quality of the other officers’ groups are beyond his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maggie who once knew the situation of the Julesian army dangled in front of Hid: "The calculation of 300 people seems to be underestimated. I need to be a Are we planning to retreat after the Fergota brigade is destroyed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The security minister muttered to himself and forked a body with a blade on his right arm. His magic gathered at the top of his right arm, and the body of the enemy soldier was immediately broken into bone meal and blood. He shook and shook off part of the meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the morale of the opponent is high and the command is steady, then I will create their own chaos. Bloody shield (bloodyshield)."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone and blood are organized around his body and turned into a strong shield. Sid is a cold and ugly person, but after shrouded this horrible armor, it looks like a demon returning from hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let my flag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sid’s voice is hidden behind the blood. It sounds a bit low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the Marquis of Ellen Palenia, none of my eleven predecessors died in bed. Sid Naser has the ability to fight The first line, and Conti? Fox can't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12th Security Minister of the Holy Coman Empire took a step, like a machine, The pendulum-like rhythm steadily walks toward the enemy's second Vauban. Behind him, it is the counter-attack reserve team that is also marching on the rhythm, and the proud flag of the governor’s brigade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this line of defense, it is the main force of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sid pointed to the commander of the opposing enemy and gave a demonstrative blow. The top of the right-wing blade is malicious, and the metal-casting circuit is full of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the arm makes a finger, the blood bomb penetrates the body of the opposite officer and falls down. Even with the phantom limbs, the right arm of the Security Minister still has the same ability to kill and suppress as the hand. All the attacks were unabashedly pointing to the other officer's officer and caster, and the gentleman's mask was completely torn off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just the same way you are on the South Line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-***-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August 6th, 1666 (mday +127)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jena? Free Army General Command<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***-** *-***-***-***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergency call badge is called back to each level of work in the secondary position Magic officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every officer of the Free Army will be associated with this low-cost and confidential magic communicator, which has only one function, that is, the flash heats up to tell the holder There is an urgent order to be given to him. This is one of the secrets of the Free Army's ability to fight against the empire with a large number of low-level casters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry about what password, urgent call!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light badge, running over the guard whistle, rushed into the door of the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is absolutely impossible in front of him: every room in the headquarters is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Command is now busy with all sorts of news. In order to deal with the complicated information in the war, only in the headquarters, there should be more than 20 officers who can use communication magic to communicate with the various units, and five times the number of officers here command the front line or the summary reconnaissance unit. The conclusion. With more troops and guards, the command should have more than two hundred officers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all rooms are empty, only his own footsteps echo in the hallway. The staff is still there, but there are no staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door with doubts went to the main meeting room and pushed the door open. In the conference room where the crowds were swaying, there were only a few officers who also received the summoning order, and the old fox sitting at the end of the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conti? The hair of Marshal Fox seems to be a lot of white at night, and the figure looks old. He sat in an armchair in the late Regency style of the Second Empire, with his hands crossed in front of him, his eyes lowered, and he seemed to be staring at the map on the table, and he seemed to be staring at nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shelling command staff is resistant to the door? Soledon is ordered to return to the team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reported his own task, just picked a stool and sat down at the far end of the big long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to talk about the reason you are late, anyway, you don't need a briefing." Seeing people already, the marshal is screaming, "just like you. Knowing that our front is at its most dangerous time. The charge of the Warlord Brigade is determined and the target is clear. More than one-third of the frontline officers have already sacrificed in the first round of exchange."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is whispering because everyone understands the situation. The door that commanded the shelling at the top of the organ tower was very clear about the severity of the frontline battle: after the blood-red figure wiped out a quarter of the officers, even if he and the organists on the organ did their best, they could not stop the emperor* * Punish the entire line of defense. One after another company, after the heavy losses of officers and veterans, withdrew uncontrollably and exposed the broad side of the offensive force to Sid Nath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the staff officers have been invested in the second provisional battle group as commanding officers, but you can also figure out that the current situation is not optimistic. Except for the strength of defending Jena, we have the last experienced team in our hands. Although the number is small, it is already our last reserve team... and the enemy is likely to have at least 10 brigades. Force. Although the entire southern line is now caught in an unexplained magical mess, time is still not our friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jena claims 15,000 freedom The army, but only about 4,000 of them are veterans, except for recruits who have only one or two months to join the army. These people are not lacking in patriotic enthusiasm, but also dare to sacrifice for the country, but they are not capable of facing the real battlefield of flesh and blood. This counterattack cast more than half of the veterans and almost all of the officers. After these people lost their command, it is already a great thing to rely on the recruits to organize defenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really want to lead this army myself, but everyone does not allow me to do this." Marshal Fox smiled bitterly. "So, I have to take this one." The troops are handed over to you. Naimen? Captain Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young officer was studying the map in front of the farthest end of the table, heard his name, and stood up in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are now the third temporary combat group commander, Captain Soledon." Marshal Fox crossed the fingers, "If the second line of defense is not Live, you have to gather all the broken soldiers, reorganize the queue, and fight for time for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is wide open, the fingers are pinching the table On the side, I used all my strength to control the trembling of my legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final reserve team commander! Even the staff at the table are junior and middle-magic officers who graduated from the Lenny Army College or the School of Strategy. He never thought that such a young officer could master such an important force. If he fails, the entire Jena logistics base will fall into the enemy, and the most elite troops of the Free Army will be trapped in the narrow area of ​​Jena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, it is the failure of the entire war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slight sweat on the forehead of the door: "Lord Marshal, this task is too heavy for me -"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This unit has only 500 people. It is no bigger than the troops you have commanded. In addition to the shortage of officers, there is no special place to pay attention to. You can use Senior sergeant as your commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, I am not sure-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marshal Fox’s arm fell on the table: “Without me, no one here is sure, Captain.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was deeply breathed. The words of Marshal Fox are all mentioned, and it is reasonable to say that he should not deny it; but he knows what the commander of a force trying to turn the tide will encounter. He witnessed Sid’s death assault, and he was not sure he could escape from the man. If he is a real soldier, he should not hesitate to take this task and use it as a stepping stone for his own promotion...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is still too difficult Yes, sir. I may let you down, or ask someone to direct it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this passage, he almost bit his tongue. He is not always a competent soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal’s gaze rested on the medal on his chest. Today, the door is not wearing a lot of medals, only the second-class freedom and two blood medals, and the rest of the medals are hidden in the wallet - of course, fear of being targeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have seen your resume, you have a very good combat experience and personal ability. But this is not the reason I choose you. I choose you, just Because you often stand in the most unfortunate position, but every time you can seize the opportunity to escape the birth of the day. The rest of the people may have higher ranks and better education, but they are not as experienced as you. The test. I need a tough and good luck person as the last line of defense. This person is you, Captain. I will give you this last hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;No choice. The door closed his eyes and nodded. He did not go to see the gaze, sympathy and regret of those colleagues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, Marshal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of things I can't tell you, but you You must be convinced that this is not a mission to die. You only need to stop the opponent's offensive, it is enough. Come back alive." Marshal Fox encouraged, "Do you have any needs?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still need one thing: Your marshal command flag. Please allow me to use this banner to boost morale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The door resistance bites the teeth and raises a bit of a non-point requirement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kenigler's Fox" sinks a bit and smiles on his face: "That is nothing but a flag. If you think it will be useful, take it." Well, it’s on our former command tower.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Captain Sormon, the 500th veteran of the third temporary battle group, And a marshal flag set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the 12th Security Minister Sid Nath had just cut the troops of the second provisional battle group into two. The outcome of the battle seems to be about to be separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
