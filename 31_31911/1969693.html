On the face of Captain Soledon, he was a little uncomfortable when he came out from the dark underground. He stretched his arm and made sure there was nothing wrong with the transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really didn't apply for positioning at the Lenny Center transfer point. Is a new mathematical transformation? It seems that mathematics is progressing in the next two centuries. Big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took two steps forward, but suddenly heard the shouts of shouting and the sound of a collision with the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Who are you, how can you use the transfer magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a The sentinel of the gun was staring nervously at him and the transmission point, and his eyes were incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door hurriedly raised his hands and said that he was not hostile: "I am..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two sentinels did not let him finish. They also stared at the big scary medal in front of the chest and shouted its name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excellent chapter." "It is a chapter of excellence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sentry is struggling The head of the first sentinel: "Stupid! Now you can use magic, only those two people! Let's go and ask the officers to come over, the superior captain is back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Hearing this name, the door is stunned, and there is a kind of unpredictable hunch in my heart. He repeated it in a low voice to make sure he didn't misunderstand any syllable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excellent Captain? Are you not mistaken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sentry I slap my head and understand: "Oh, you haven't heard of it. When you heard the news, Lord Fox said, 'It seems that it is not only the saint who can save freedom, but our superior captain is not bad either." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is hand-held on his forehead, feeling a burst of force: "If you must give someone a nickname...Please choose a better one, Lord Fox. Don't use this nickname like the third-rate pictorial protagonist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the time to talk to Lord Fox when you ask for help. Right. Don't forget me, I will definitely sign up! The emperor who has no magic support is not terrible at all! We can destroy them, at any time, sir! Please lead us to counterattack, superior captain ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to these words, Ninmen realized that he was eager to stick to Lenny and even counterattack. Just lawmakers. A victory from the bottom of the valley can bring such amazing morale, so that the soldiers feel that they can do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to think so. Now investing all the troops to fight, it is indeed possible to destroy the emperor and his last troops. In Jena, the Freedom Army smashed the vanguard of the North Army. In Lenny, the Free Army smashed the main cluster. There are only two parts left in the final combat power of the emperor, Brigham's Figota and the north of the mixed cluster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now he knows that this is a fragile speculation. This scene has been seen several times, whether it is self-employed, friendly or enemy. Temporary morale can only reverse the current situation of the war, and it is impossible to reverse it forever. Morale cannot be turned into ammunition, it cannot become a supplementary soldier, and it cannot become a reinforcement of the whole group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Population does not necessarily bring victory, it may bring a bigger disaster..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Ironically, this truth was taught to him by the imperial emperor. Not everyone can agree with this truth. This thing may be more difficult than he thought before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are worried about this." The sentry smiled. "You don't have to worry. The entire senior officer of the Lenny Army can count it with two hands. The staff is even rare. How can it be your turn?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are the senior officers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The officer's office is in the parliament building In the foyer. All officers who are above the eunuch and lose their system must return to the team and confirm their identity... Of course you should not use it.” The sentinel glanced at the medal of excellence on his chest and returned to the post after a military ceremony. On, to receive more bursts of soldiers slowly coming along the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the crowded square. The night before, it was also singing and dancing, a peaceful scene. Last night, Freedom Square was a fierce battlefield where firepower was intertwined. Now, uniforms of various colors are mixed, and their flags are not organized as regulations. At first glance, there are at least 10,000 people crowded in the square. When the number reaches this level, it is impossible to count if there is no queue. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eunuch and the non-commissioned officers with the interim squadrons are walking in the crowd, shouting the names and names of the troops from time to time, and reorganizing the scattered soldiers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s the chaos of the organization or the lack of officers, it’s shocking. The door does not want to do much, and with his left hand barely cover the medal of excellence on his chest, mixed in the crowd to the main entrance of the parliament building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can't cover his own epaulettes. An eunuch who was in charge of the alert at the top of the stairs stopped him when he was about to walk to the 20th and 2nd steps of the parliament building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The captain over there, and the ensign of the man behind him, come here to register! You don't look like there is a force, you lose the preparation." The officer has to re-appoint his position... Wait a minute, you are the door to the door? Sorrenton sir! Don't stop, we have seen the chapter of excellence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very familiar. When the door looked up, he saw the old-fashioned face of Lieutenant Garnier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shout has caught everyone’s attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the door is awkward, and he feels that everyone around him is gathering on his own. People's arguments are loud, and it's unclear how the crashing soldiers have asked the people around them for details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Renmen? Soledon, who is that?" "It seems to be a superior captain?" "It is the guardian of the saint, stupid!" "Ah. Is the legendary free saint coming, where is it? I heard that it is amazing!" "Her guard officer should be a great guy!" "Of course, the youngest in the history of the Free Army." Zhang, the chief staff officer of the First Republic Division!" "I heard that as long as he is the commanding force, no matter what kind of fiasco can survive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old The mercenary's look changed, and he hurriedly pushed the crowd down the steps, and couldn't take care of the salute. He pulled the hand of the door and dragged him out of the crowd. Behind them, the crazy free soldiers reached out like zombies and grabbed them, almost tearing off the sleeves of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rushing to the top of the steps, the two still panted and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hold, sorry, sir, I am not thinking about it." The old mercenary apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it doesn't matter, you can escape. I thought it would be torn into pieces." The door wiped the sweat, "Hey, the lieutenant rank "High rise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparly stood up! "Not only me, we all have a temporary rank. We're acropolis" The battalion was the first force to return to the Central Committee and was the most powerful force in this victory. With the consent of Commander Fox, we are already a formal independent camp, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Acropolis Camp? It is a permanent establishment..." Nanimen felt that the situation had changed rapidly. "So, you and Spari are both senior commanders of this battalion?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" is also the deputy battalion commander of the Acropolis Independent Camp. Captain Luge is the temporary battalion commander. If you are the chief, the new staff is definitely to be reused. There is no chance to direct us. What do you mean by saying that it is a permanent establishment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garnier opened his mouth. He is actually not aware of the history and history of the cheap chief, and most of the stories spread are fabricated. Compared with the facts, those fabricated stories seem to be conservative. The entire Freedom Army had only one permanent division of independent battalions before the First Republic, and the Shangyu staff had formed two of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you, how did you do it... forget it, I will ask if you have time. Good operation, I remember."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negemon also does not want to continue to talk about this topic, the words turn: "You just said 'Fox Commander'? The commander of the Free Army should not be the Joint Council "President?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. Marshal Fox has resigned from the military, so he can no longer return to the current position as the free Marshal of the Freedom. As the speaker was already killed in the chaos last night, they voted unanimously by the interim parliament, and they unanimously agreed that the former Freedom Marshal of Conti Fox was appointed as the commander-in-chief of all the Freedom Forces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The old mercenary explained, "But everyone is not too concerned about these changes, but the legend of you and the lady of the saint is very popular. You are now the hottest and most popular story of the relationship between men and women in the Freedom Army. Not only us. The commander-in-chief also worked hard, and everyone below heard his two words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is curious: "Which two sentences?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gagnell once said: "Hey... ...I don't have any culture, I don't remember..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another voice came in and solved for him. This sound is also very familiar to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'When right is at risk, fortunately there is a saint on its side. After a hundred years, we will also be grateful to the gods. 'And there' It seems that it is not only the saint who can save freedom, but our superior captain is not bad either. Then, Captain Soleton, who is promoted to the temporary major, please come to me to sign in."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second lieutenant Spari sat in front of the registration desk, with two goose pens in the hand to open the bow, while writing two documents - the strength of the military school is really extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spari concentrated all the staff officers who could be found, moved the table out of the parliament building, and established a staff at the top of the steps. Clerical office. After he finished writing the right hand, he took two sheets of paper from the bottom of the pile and placed them on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, your registration document is a separate one. The commander-in-chief personally asked him, and he has already written it. This is the lady of the saint. No one knows the name, you go back and fill it for her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a bitter smile: "She may not be able to report it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding atmosphere is suddenly frozen. Seven or eight eunuchs jumped from their seats at the same time, and there were exclamations and lamentations. Seventy or eighty fists were clenched at the same time. Three or forty tigers and tigers were tearful, and they were about to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen realized that he was in trouble and hurriedly corrected: "No, you will be wrong, her preparation is originally the second 'Intre 'Master, now is to send the magic back to Interre to treat the injury. You know, she broke her foot and could not be treated in Lenni..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You don't lie to us, how is this possible? The central location of the Lenny in the ring has been destroyed! Chief, you have to make a good faith lie, please make a round."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Spari also dropped the quill in his hand, smashed up from the chair and asked emotionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The method of her own arrival." Nana knew that he should not say the truth of the "pure gold" private transmission anchor point, and quickly abdified, "You I think, she is a person who can block all the magic of Lenny, one person breaks the main force and reverses the whole war! This is all new magic or secret magic! Such a person, she will be affected by the problem of Lenny's positioning point. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All face each other and breathe a sigh of relief and return to their posts. The door can hear their arguments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s great that the saint is not dead." "Should it be the lord of the saint? The lieutenant general of the Magic Service Command, the Major Generals also died." Now, I think the Virgin took over. "In the magical warrior, who can defeat the entire Emperor's main corps alone? Lieutenant General is too low, how can I get a general." "Maybe Marshal?" "There is only one Marshal of the Army, Lord Krad Lopez of the Western Army." "Yes, there is only one Marshal of the Army, but who must say that it must be the Field Marshal? First, the Field Marshal is a positive word, we can have a negative version. For example, 'the army female marshal'. Or refer to the practice of the free navy, they have an equivalent position, the first admiral of the navy, and our army marshal, the lady of the saint can also be the 'first general of the magic army'... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In any case, you haven't even seen Anne in front of me. I even kissed her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about some unbalanced thoughts and walked into the parliament building in. The hall has been transformed into the war room of the staff department. He is holding a second lieutenant and inquiring about the new unit he is going to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a member of the door? Captain Soledon, who has already registered, is there a report from the staff of the Lenny Army?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice came from the end of the hall: "Your words are coming to me, Major Soledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Resist the door and walk past the tables that are full of documents and walk close to the speaker's large armchair. The door to the main hall of the parliament was tightly closed, but the door was still able to hear the sound of the speech that was being heard. The parliament and the military are just one door apart. This door is so tightly closed, not a good sign, he thought. I am afraid that the differences between the two sides are already very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are... Major General McCash of the National Guard... No, Lieutenant General."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Recognizing that the other person is a person who presents a superior chapter to himself, and he is very busy and respects the other's rank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McCash nodded and returned, and took a chair and asked him to sit down and began to explain the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, there is no National Guard and Lenny Army. After we discussed with Commander Fox, we unified the Lenny Army and the National Guard. The Southern General Army. Secondly, I am now a temporary lieutenant general... Three of the divisional divisions of the official free division, two dereliction of duty, one whereabouts are unknown. In addition to the lieutenant in the tenth division of the defense zone in the South Third District In addition, I am the second in the command sequence of the Southern Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Southern Army." Namimen keenly captured the meaning of the name. The voice was depressed. "Is the Commander-in-Chief wanting to withdraw from Lenny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McCash clapped his hands impatiently: "Don’t be stupid. This No one in the house is not so judged, you must be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doorman smiled twice and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly promoted lieutenant shook his head and pointed to the side door on the other side: "Okay, don't gossip. Commander Fox has an order, once the door is resistant Captain Solerton and the Lieutenant of the Virgin came back to report, and I will see you immediately. Where is the girl? Listen to the people in your army who say that they are like beautiful gods, I want to see..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanmen skipped the latter half of the problem and focused on the first half: "What? I thought the commander-in-chief was fighting with the members in the parliament, he was not inside. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord's military affairs are very busy, and they must command the various affairs of the Southern Army. They are not entangled with the one hundred members. I also Very busy.” McCash smiled. “Of course, since you are here, he may not be so busy. This is the art of dealing with the parliament. You will understand it sooner or later.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His suggestion is very obvious: only the general will deal with the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hint has put some extra pressure on the door. He "fighted" and responded a few times. After leaving the game, he left the war department and walked into the side door next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But his heart is faint and a little excited. General - maybe it's too soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked along the signpost on the new post, and soon found the office of the former speaker--now the office of Commander-in-Chief of Conti? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tapped three times: "Nermen? Captain Soledon came to report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" Come in." A sounding old voice replied, "I have been waiting for you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the white-haired Conti? The old Marshal Fox is sitting behind the speaker's desk. His hair color and beard color changed the door to surprise: only when he was sent back to Lenny yesterday morning, Conti Fox was still a gray-haired old man - now he is completely white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You came an hour later than I expected. I thought before, if you heard the call to arrive immediately, it means you have only luck. If you arrive an hour or two later than the call, You are very talented to be a good combat staff. If you arrive an hour ago, you can even be a good politician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old man Staring at the door with his eagle's gaze. Resist the door to close the lips, without a word, waiting for the commander-in-chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now... there are two possibilities. One possibility is that you have analyzed the deeper situation in a more critical situation. Another possibility is that you touch I have some unexpected events, or both. In either case, I would like to quote it, which was circulated in the military about 20 years ago to evaluate a person's sentence. Maybe it works for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door knows that it is time for you to speak: "Excuse me, what do they say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If things go on like this, Naimen? Soledon will one day become the Marshal of the Freedom. This is my idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox Take a cyan oriental porcelain bottle and lick the colorless liquid in the bottle into your goblet. Unfamiliar wine shrouded the entire room, and the door sniffed twice, rubbing his nose and realizing that it was not red wine or distilled wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the original owner of this sentence, I have a bottle. I am very good, the flavor of the great country. He said that there is also a small country in the East. The flavor is also very interesting, there is a chance to find it for me to taste - of course, it is costly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door tentatively asked: " Was this sentence originally used to describe Lord Marshal Klaude Lopez?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is actually not a good word. You must know that this sentence was spoken nearly twenty years ago. It is this sentence that forced Going to Clade and making him a veteran mercenary commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this sentence, he couldn't help but think of Renee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young man is too good to be a good thing...even in this country known as 'freedom'. No, it may be more than the empire. Stav and his nobles can master the army in their twenties, and what about us?” Fox smiled bitterly. “Although Clarke was still the marshal he dreamed of... but what did he pay for? The price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door does not know how to answer the words, can only listen to the old marshal slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are somewhat similar to him, but perhaps more extreme than him. You have extreme good fortune and extreme bad luck. You will be in the worst case. Next, I will turn the tide. I think that 'strong luck' is the most appropriate description of this situation. Only at a critical moment can one see the essence of a person. Only in the most extreme circumstances can one change the essence of a person. You are the kind of person who will continue to encounter these situations... Is it bad luck, or good luck?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox stood up Find another crystal goblet from the side of the cabinet. He took another drink and gave it to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is busy with his hand: "Hello, I am on duty, not very convenient to drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Commander-in-Chief Command." Fox smiled. "Drink. Just celebrate the wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, the old man uses his own cup I touched the cup in the hand of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was bitten and bitten, and poured out the strange oriental wine. The impact of this wine is great, he only feels that a wine is directed at the eyes of the blind, just like a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this sentence will not change. I firmly believe that I will not misunderstand one's ability and luck. Maybe I want to change it. No matter what." Going down, Naimen? Soledon will one day become a Marshal of the Freedom, or something else in the same position. To be honest, if I am twenty years younger, I might see you as one of the most dangerous factors in the Free Army. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there must be many people who think so, even if the free nations have reached the most dangerous time. No, even if the freedoms of the nations are dying, you will be very dangerous in our army. Every system and every society There are drawbacks, and when their dark side is revealed, it will always be darker than you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old marshal said and made a drink. Looking at the face of Fox's sloppy wine, "Kenigler's Fox" is old. He is so old that he is forced to be white by the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must be thinking now, I am old like a greedy old man? Should I ask your beautiful Saint Valentine now? Where, by the way, consider whether there is a chance to reunite Fangze and consolidate my image."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the old Marshal who did not hesitate to break his heart completely smashed, Coughing is not limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox smiled a little, grabbed his hand, filled the glass again, and refused to refuse the underground command: "Don’t lie. Drink."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door endured and poured a cup, and now there is already a fire in the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't look at me old, you should hate now, you should regret why you are so young, and you are born in our country. Heroes less than twenty years old." Captain... If you are a 40-year-old heroic colonel, just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old marshal sighed and shook his head at the door - possibly No shaking, but he saw a ghost, he could not tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We already have Clade Lopez on the Northern Line, it is an opponent who can't destroy the empire. He has a very good deputy. What is it called, the one who is a member of the Ruhrlock, is also decisive and decisive, and the magical ability may be higher than that of Clade. The only weakness is the lack of resistance and the difficulty of coping with the real big situation. Anyway, the empire Wanting to put out the northern line of the two men’s joint efforts is simply an idiotic dream. Even with the elves, they can only eliminate one of them. However, no one can entrust the southern line and the newly established Southern Army. You are a forty-year-old colonel, and I can safely entrust this army to you...but not. If the saint is using her power, I can entrust this army to you and her. ...but it takes time. Even if it is a saint, it takes at least six months to establish her prestige. Time is not enough, too short, too short."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The old marshal shook his head again. More and more ghosts are coming up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The battle of Lenny is the victory that you brought. Yes, what victory is that? It’s a terrible victory. The whole city defense, the Lenny Army, All of them are in a mess. If I am Gustav, the latest tomorrow, the fastest tomorrow, the army will once again set foot on Lenny, and this time, you will no longer have the advantage of a new magic raid. I am right, excellent. Major?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Ningmen made a nap, and then the wine made a non-point request, "Hey... can you please do not call Is this nickname?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young man." The old Marshal shook his head. "Well, I know that you really want to be awesome." The nickname, such as 'Kengler's Fox', actively spreads out. Believe me, you will regret it when you are old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please tell me . . What we are going to do now. You said the saint, Lieutenant Sefer, she will leave Lenny to go to Interre for physical treatment, but she will go We can give us a lot of help before. If there is anything we can do, please do not hesitate to order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kongti took a shot Head: "Lieutenant Sefer. Lieutenant Sefer. Sky Blue Crystal. I will forget the name of such a beautiful girl, it is really old. You mean, we really can't get the support of powerful new magic in the day after tomorrow." You probably won't be able to do the same magical support as her, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door leaned down a little: "Yes. But I think "It will be done one day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a good thing for young people to be so confident, and it’s a good thing to be so eager for strength and power." The old marshal smiled again. "There is only one thing we can do. The parliament is solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is wide open : "Solution...Solve?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old man finally said the topic, Nana was excited: "Please tell me what is the Parliament discussing now? Is it necessary to retreat, or do you want to stick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox Coughed twice: "No, you are too optimistic. They are discussing ... to stick to it, or to counterattack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Naimen opened his eyes in disbelief. "Are they crazy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are not crazy, but they are smart. You must know first. Some facts, this will be useful to you in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox’s hand is on a paper at the table, "The number of members of the Joint Council is two hundred and twenty. One person, 50 in each Republic, 20 in the Rennie district, and one speaker. In addition to the twice-yearly plenary meeting, we guarantee that one-half of the members of parliament will carry out daily legislation and Political discussion. Now it is a war period. We originally had more than 130 members of parliament. And the riots, only 97 people can return now, barely more than the minimum quorum of 75. So I can hold an ad hoc meeting and successfully become the commander-in-chief."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door counts these numbers - he suddenly understands the origin of the twenty-two steps in front of the parliament building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the commander-in-chief suddenly became fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this one hundred and thirty people, there were probably sixty or seventy people who used the emperor to change their minds. They all dreamed of becoming new. The Marquis and Earl. Among the Conservatives, this is almost an open secret. These people certainly will not escape and will not die - except for a few executed on the spot because of treason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sixty or seventy... Do you mean that potential surrenders actually account for the majority in the interim parliament?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox slowly nodded: "Yes. However, in the current situation, they can no longer surrender two words. Instead, they must scream out that they must counterattack. After such a long time. The adjustment of the two sides should be higher and higher, and now it is possible to have the emperor emperor, and directly to the Delandi. Of course, if the war is unfavorable - this will happen one day sooner or later - they will immediately change their character. If we After withdrawing from the Mt. Bis River, they will also establish a puppet government for the emperor in Lenni."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is much more complicated than that envisaged before the end of the door, he It’s impossible to solve every problem by suddenly finding out every way that you have imagined to reverse the resolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can't fight against the great danger, we don't have the long-term defense. We can't simply retreat, otherwise the retreat itself will be empire." There are other countermeasures, sir? Do we really have a way to withdraw the main force from Lenny and not let the empire and speculators use the plan here?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conti? Fox put down the bottle and stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was no such thing, so I told them that the military is busy. But your arrival has brought a different solution. Let's go, resistance Gate? Major Solton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and walked out the door. In the heart of the door, he guessed the idea of ​​the old marshal, no, the commander-in-chief, and followed him to the parliament hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you need me to do, sir? I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People don't Two steps into the same river.” The commander-in-chief suddenly quoted a proverb. “You just need to cooperate with my actions. All the problems and all obstacles you worry about will be solved. Major.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Conti Fox pushed the door to the temporary parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry to interrupt you, but I have a new proposal to be submitted to distinguished members."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The whole venue was quiet, and the members of the Provisional Parliament stared at the commander-in-chief of all the Freedom Forces with vigilance, waiting for him to tell his opening remarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
