The cumulative mobilization of more than 150,000 people, the Gustav emperor with absolute superior strength did not completely solve the southern problem, they failed to defeat the opposite free army that was not prepared at the beginning, and gave the other side to rebuild the army. Opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the west of the Ridge Mountains, the northern aristocrats ended up with only 60,000 troops, defending the West Rylock and the third. The special area of ​​Lenny; opposite them, is a nearly powerful and long-awaited test of the South Army, consisting of the 25,000 New Rennie Army of the Upper Meiya and the 30,000 Western Generals of East Ruhrock . With less than 150,000 people, there is no hope for 60,000 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, they have also ignited all the savings of the entire civilized world in the past decade. Not only did all human banks buy too many war bonds, but even the elf bankers of Hongrinasti began to feel that the money was tight, which brought the entire New World economy into panic. The madness of the empire and the republics to warfare, causing a money shortage in the distant Eastern Empire, the chief university student of Huachao suddenly found that he could not get as much money to support his tax reform plan as in previous years. The big names also had to stop their high-level reforms and began to use the grain harvest to count their respective strengths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worse, this impact will last for more than a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Excerpted from Maggie yavi, the first volume of Modern History of Akrania, the beginning of modernity (1666-1682) Chapter<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The book owner’s comment on the title page: If I have time, I would like to study the book’s name, author, volume and content and me. The subtle difference in the version of memory.-)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;August 27, 1666<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Kingdom of the Southern Territory of the Koman Empire (West Ruhrock), Kings River West Coast Avenue<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large-scale army is not easy Re-fixed the road ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This army has about 100 cavalrymen and more than 300 horsemen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a cavalry squadron plus three infantry companies, the transport of the carriage has more than 130. Rather than being an elite army, it is more like a transport team with excess defense power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all modern troops, this army also has many battle flags painted with various coats of arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every company will carry four or five flags, of which there must be two sides to identify the flag: one side is the iron-gray oblique cross royal coat of arms of the Holy Empire. The other side is the purple 苜蓿 徽 徽 flag of the Figota family. If you have a person who is well versed in heraldry, you can identify a lot of information from the peripheral side pattern that has been urgently modified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the succinct proof of the main pattern "purple 苜蓿" proves that this is a "duke" banner, not a certain Fegota separation "Marquis" or " The flag of the Earl. The tassel at the end of the flag uses white lace, which proves that the owner of the flag is the Duke of the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oblique cross of the upper left quadrant indicates that the female duke has sworn allegiance to the emperor, and the blank on the upper right indicates that she has not yet obtained all her vassals. Swear allegiance. According to the development of the future situation, it is possible to draw an olive branch, indicating that the vassals have all loyalty; or cross the sword, indicating that the lord is determined to use force to suppress all compliant vassals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the new team of the Duke of Fegota, who are preparing to meet with the main players of the Figota. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shower in the river valley of the late summer season, which made the ground muddy. The mud pits along the road are fine, and occasionally there will be mud puddles that cut off the entire road, so that the whole team has to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this season in the spring, it will not be so exaggerated." Some soldiers passed through here in the spring campaign, and they still had an impression on the then Wang Zhe Avenue. "At that time, the southern trip was a good repair. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all this war. In the summer, you dig, I also dig, and finally dig a good road into a muddy dirt road. It is no wonder that the South Army is so refreshed that it will withdraw from the west of the King River. These traitors are still waiting to see jokes. In retrospect, it is really smooth in the spring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can it not be successful? The largest mobilization in the history of the empire, the first alliance with the sharp ears, but also catch up with the Freedom of the Army, Steele sit quietly let us pass, we never played It’s so smooth. I can make such a good start into this muddy quarry, and the Emperor’s Majesty has not been amazed. The most bloody is not our Figota!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Can't blame the big guys on the top, the South Army is still playing Very tough. The commanding of the overall but the old Duke's Highness, even he did not win, what can the emperor do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of Lenny, food I can still eat at the beginning of September. At this time, I remembered our Figota public, and we all looked at the supply we delivered..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Speaking, Jena's South Army is willing to resell it. I heard that it is rich in wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible? The traitors are the same It is difficult to supply, I heard that Lopez has taken his troops to Faures to eat. It should be winter... Can I go home for the winter this year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The soldiers snorted and chatted about the current situation. If a month ago, their chiefs would not hesitate to send these guys to the military judges, but now their aristocratic commanders have joined the chat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the war has been over for more than half a month. For those emperors who have been fighting for nearly half a year, they can go home on the agenda. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Freedom Army’s civil unrest in the deep winter begins, there has been a full eight-month war on this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Meteby River to the Oslo River, from Emerald Bay to the Great Wilderness, the war has almost swept half of the land of the free nations, hundreds of towns As a result of the ruins, the cumulative casualties on both sides exceeded 200,000 and more than one million refugees were displaced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better than the previous few free wars, this time the two sides did not hit one side of the entire army, but only the two sides were unable to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This peace is more stable than peace in the treaty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing that he lost almost all the supplies stored in Lennie, Marshal Lopez, the Supreme Commander of the Free Army in Jena, immediately accepted the new An order of the military government and the dictator. The Western Generals withdrew from the King River and established a new stronghold in East Ruhrlock and began collecting the first batch of autumn food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that the Emperor can move freely west of the King River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ceasefire agreement, there was also a speech by Conti, the Fox dictator, "Going to the Free Land." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of the ceasefire treaty, the tide of refugees who have been suppressed for a long time has finally begun to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the northwestern region of Ruhrock and Florinas, humans and half-elfs have left the home as towns, rushing carriages and cattle carts. , drag racing and even rickshaws fled to East Ruhrlock and Shangyi Meiya under the control of the Free Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road leading to the fortress of the first free fleet station on the coast of Witland is also congested, and the officers of the Sansen team took the opportunity to set up the road card and wanted to strip it. The last copper in these people’s wallets began to plan an embargo on the Witland Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceasefire agreement has been seventeen days so far, and the refugees have reached the farthest reaches of Fort. On the riverside avenue of the king, there are also refugees in groups and yellow skinny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, the commander of the avant-garde team felt that something was wrong. He hurriedly summoned his own combat detachment and wanted to disperse these refugees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't use it, use a spear handle and a butt!" The knight who had just discussed the current affairs with his subordinates had to wave his own command sword. "Be sure to disperse the magical units before they arrive. If necessary, you can shoot them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cold female voice interrupted his order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I seem to hear you say something about dispersing refugees and shooting, Baron von Taco. Although you are a knight directly under the Emperor's Majesty, But the orders we received should be the same? Please repeat them for me, Baron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight turned his head in panic and saw the name A cool young woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is wearing a dusty dress, the color is the lavender that the Figota family will use in formal occasions, with bright white decorations. side. The cap of the military cap was so low that it almost covered her bright eyes and slender eyelashes. Probably to minimize the gender symbol, her hair is almost in the military cap, only a few tan hair from the side of the cap of the military cap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... von? The Grand Duke of Fegota!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whip in the hands of the Duke Gently swirling in the air, making a crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Repeat the order you received for me, Mr. Baron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The knight's position, his status, or the other's gender, the Cavaliers commander did not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swallowed and replied: "First, resume the command of the various troops in the north of Jena. Second, stay with you." The remaining South Army negotiated, resolutely implemented the ceasefire agreement, and persuaded them to hand over their strongholds. Third, redeem the prisoners of the Jena prison camp, especially to ensure that the first princess still in the hands of the South Army, His Royal Highness Olia ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, here is very close to Jena, are you going to destroy these orders?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young new female duke turned over and sneered. The entourage and guards around her also hurriedly followed her. The Duke of Fegota frowned at the more than a hundred refugees and turned to ask her adjutant: "Colonel Itis, I remember when you came to join us, the original public in Blenheim. Already arrived in the north of Jena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the Duke of the Duke. That is my command."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Known as "Colonel Itis" is a young woman with a strong charm, she is also wearing a lavender Fegota public uniform uniform, it seems that it is less than thirty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the outside, it is difficult to see that she was the best agent of the empire. Whether in the civil war in the Republic, the game of "Fog Eagle" is the backbone of the secret front. After receiving the trust of Seneca Weilun, she reorganized the retreat in the defeat of Jena, and stabilized the army in the name of the second female Duke in Blenheim. As soon as the ceasefire agreement was signed, the colonel immediately greeted her lord with the Principality of the Principality. Her old boss security minister had to fully acknowledge her position in the future Pyganta Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the Lenny Court thinks that if Jonica Veron von Figota is able to successfully inherit the Principality, then Itis Magnum is very promising to be the prime minister of her Principality. Two women from the South will rule the most powerful Duke of the Holy Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That means, we should be able to get supplies anytime, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I think so, the Duke of the Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter of Dinka? Weilun nodded: "That's easy. We can use The food on these two cars is paid for the refugees here to leave. After all, it is still far from here to Lennie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, is that good? Your Highness? What do you say, those southern citizens who want to escape from the empire's territory..." Itiston paused and deliberately glanced at the other people around him in front of Monica, who were in the eyes of the northerners. Disdain, "Do you want to use valuable materials in exchange for a smooth road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renee sighed and lowered her voice: "And... actually I can understand the idea that they don't want to live under the rule of the empire or the elves. Everyone should have the freedom to choose their loyalty to the regime, isn't it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis silently. As a descendant of an old royal party, she also faces the same situation as Yanika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 raised the whip and slightly raised the voice: "Since I am going to rule the Principality of Figota, I hope it will be a place where people voluntarily live here." The land, not a piece of land that needs to be used to stop the people from escaping. I believe that all my people also think so. These refugees may one day be my people."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard her words, some soldiers thought thoughtfully, and more soldiers showed a contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, they started organizing refugees to use ropes to pull the carriage out of the quagmire. The magic users around the 黛nica also began to use their magic to re-harden the quagmire and repair the bauxite. The refugees dug up the slate and stone from the mud to re-lay it on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the troops began to move forward again. In the following roads, such quagmire has repeatedly appeared, and the soldiers of the Pegota Principality are treated as usual. Thanks to the processing experience, each time they fix it faster than the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fourth time, the young female duke frowned. She stopped at a horse in front of a newly repaired quagmire, wondering if the mud pit would be too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice sounded in her ear at the right moment, reminding her of the anomaly here: "Not quite right, 黛妮卡. It’s very close to Jena. Why is the condition of the road worse than that of the South? The Imperial Army has repaired the southern half of the King's Road. Jena's Luo... It is too strange for the Free Marshal to do anything."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since only I can hear it alone, you don't have to say it so much, Maggie." Seneca smiled and whispered, "Clad Lopez's It’s just a matter of mentioning the name directly. After all, we can’t completely avoid the huge influence of that person. I understand what you mean, you mean that these quagmire and refugees are traps, right?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly the way, the Duke of the Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchanting soul with a long green hair is gently hand-snapping Nika slammed her shoulder a few times as an answer instead of a nod. Maggie Vaughan once ruled the country in the Republic of Conroc with the help of politicians, and now accepting these Figotas for Reneka is a breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a clear understanding of myself that without Maggie’s rich experience and embarrassing political skills, she’s probably not so fast in Rennie’s new The court was recognized and added a diagonal cross on behalf of the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's why I'm afraid to find it. I used to come from this road day and night -"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I talked about this, I saw a commander from the former army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Grand Duke of the Duke! The colonel found that there was a huge quagmire in front of him, suspected to be made of magic like 'fossil for mud'. Please keep with the Central Company. Highly alert - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of his speech is really too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie's face changed slightly, his eyes immediately turned to the side of the refugees who had just received the relief and were rebuilding the road in the huge quagmire, in the nyak The whisper whispered: "Idiot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, while hearing the shouts of the commander, some of the refugees’ faces changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man who was still wearing a cloak suddenly dropped his cloak and grew up, pulling a composite short bow from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Duke is here! For freedom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shout with a hint of elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the guerrillas!!! Protect your Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf headed did not hesitate and went straight to the right chest of Renee. Obviously, he didn't want to kill the Duke, but he was definitely interested in letting this powerful magician lose his fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a sudden sneak attack, Jenny’s mouth was only slightly twitching. She lowered her head slightly, vacated her right hand and pulled out her wand from her waist, and her left hand still held the stable, just like she didn't notice the arrow at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not waited for the soldiers around to shout out their worries, and a strong magic shield suddenly appeared in the air out of thin air, blocking the bounds It’s down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Renee smashed her head and leaned over. The spurs on the heels slammed into the horse’s belly and yelled at the guerrillas who shot the cold arrows. The leader rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are so confident that I can block you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie ya? I took up the magic shield and started preparing to attack the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic you use is basically spent from me, I will still reconcile every day. You secretly test the magic in these few nights. In terms of the amount used, it is certainly no problem to block this kind of attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninja said, the fingertips are picked on the wand, a long flame The spears skyrocketed from the front end of the wand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People squat down on the spot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke whispered by horse speed Straight into the group of armed refugees, the flames in their hands flutter like a fire net. Occasionally, the magicians will try to perform the same hand-to-hand combat as the knights, but most of them do not have enough physical strength to use the spear or the sabre. They often use this short wand with easy control and magical damage instead of a long gun - at least not The tragedy in which the enemies were hit by the reaction force was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headed elf shooter seems to be ready, he lost his long hunting bow and stooped into the refugees’ group, but it’s aside Several soldiers were swept by the flame spear in the hands of Renee, and they were miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Encircle her! Signal, all hands-on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headed elf is on the ground After playing a few rounds, taking advantage of the chance that Seneca was caught by his men, he escaped the attack range of the flame pike and threw a beeping arrow into the air. The regular army does not use beeping arrows as a contact signal, but for small-capacity bandits, guerrillas and adventurers, this kind of cheap magical item that does not require a pre-arranged cipher and does not consume extra magic is the best indicator of action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were scattered gunshots from the former army, which were also mixed with the sound of a bomb. It is not difficult to get weapons during the war season. The weapons scattered in the West Ruhrock area are enough to arm the 100,000 bandits and guerrillas and the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that they now have more powerful magic. Magic Net gives everyone the opportunity to learn magic. As long as they have a piece of parchment, they can learn a variety of high-level spells that were previously considered top secret by governments and wizards associations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are responsible for defense, Maggie, I am going to use clusters to fly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I saw that the elf sang some magic in a low voice, but Reneka didn't have time to take care of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female Duke’s side is surrounded by more than 20 refugees, mostly armed with cold weapons, and even individuals holding nets, one pair I will take her back to the ransom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie ya? Veri replied, the ghost The hand crossed in the air and pulled out the defense field of different attributes. The average person can't see the soul. They only see the female duke's right hand manipulating the flame wand. The left hand's fourteen knuckles are full of magic, and there are countless defensive magic surrounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial soldiers cheered and rushed into the refugee group behind their female lords, cutting down all the refugees who dared to stand. In this cheer, Renee released the clustered missiles prepared by his left hand, killing everyone on the entire left wing in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you say that the Duke is adopted, how can it be so difficult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf cursed two sentences and completed the spell. His hand broke into the mud in the ground, and countless clay people suddenly stood up from him. It is probably exaggerated to say that it is innumerable, but three or forty is also absolutely there - it is obviously an ambush that is prepared. Ordinary magicians can summon one or two ghosts at most, and such a large number must be prepared in advance, and then activated together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clay Golem! Even the guerrillas have four magics!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Female His Royal Highness, please retreat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the expectations of the Guards, Seneca Weilun did not retreat. She took a deep breath and threw her scepter out of her hand. The flame pistol became a javelin and was inserted straight into the wizard wizard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maggie, hold me! Let's use the ice cone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡And Maggie was pouring forward with the cold magic, and the quagmire froze in front of her eyes. The horseshoes stepped on the ice and were forced to move on to the next step before skidding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assault, assault, assault! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf wizard had just escaped a sneak shot and did not expect the other party’s lord to come to him so indisputably. The cone-shaped ice thorn pierced his defensive magic, piercing his nails and knocking down all the mud monsters around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for him to vomit, he felt that his body was light and his collar seemed to be taken care of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dizzy magic pierced the nerves, and the wizard wizard was black and fainted. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 throws his captives on horseback and rushes straight through the quagmire before returning to his troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These demons and refugees are handed over to you, Junjun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Opposite the quagmire, there was a "compliance" sound full of awe. If someone had doubts about the status of Duke of Weinja Weilun von Fegota, this doubt has disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second dynasty of the Holy Coman Empire pursued a complete military system - magical talent is one of the most important components. There are no flusters in the ambush, and both the combat skills and the will to fight can be compared with the previous Marquis of von Figosta. At least in this army, no one will ever question her qualifications for inheritance, but instead turn to admire the foresight of the former Duke to accept her as a foster daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female duke nodded slightly, rushing in the direction of the forwards. At this distance, you can already hear the gunshots and shouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maggie, do you think some magic has been used better recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it because of the 'resonance effect' that was discovered last time? The empire's magicians ridiculed the opponent's stupidity. Although this can really reduce the difficulty of casting, it also reveals the secret of his magic..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that it is not that simple. After that, I also analyzed one of his magic, the 'cluster missile'. And, I also submitted this spell to Temporary Ministry of Magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost of Maggie nodded: "Yes, I know all of this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there are also parts that you don't know. This spell was invented by me. Sorelton has only seen it a few times. I actually spread the use of this magic I invented, and It's not a refactoring of his method. Just now I found that the difficulty of using this spell has dropped by almost a whole level. Suppose, this new magic net, I am afraid, can bring extra power to its creators according to the popularity of magic and knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing 黛Nika's hypothesis, Maggie, fell into meditation: "I have to say that this is a very reasonable assumption. It can explain a lot of things. But if so, the magic of the future..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the Jena army. The attacker immediately puts down his arms and surrenders. Otherwise, he will be regarded as a robber! Here is the Jena army. The attacker immediately puts down his arms and surrenders. Otherwise, he will be regarded as a robber! Here is the Jena army..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the sound-amplifying magic is sufficient, and the effect of repeated play is quite considerable, and it can definitely ensure that everyone in the entire battlefield hears this sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this familiar voice, Renee took the horse on the edge of the battlefield and watched the development of the situation with a cold eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The South Army is still very good, using pre-recorded sound reinforcement. I guess that is a recording magic stone. When we come Before, they should also get the notice of the arrival of our imperial envoys... What kind of emotion should I use to deal with such a guy, Maggie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Now tearing the face is not good for both of us. Although the other party can't possibly know the raid, it doesn't look like the South Army deliberately arranged. If they want to put us to death, they can mobilize. A larger force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie is floating in the air on the right side of 黛尼卡, while thinking about the countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not be too aggressive when dealing with the other party, and don't be too weak. Use this raid to pressure the prisoners to hand over as soon as possible, but Don't be too much. We have no evidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, no evidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renee sighed, took out her pistol, scored three bullets in the head of the elf captive, and threw the body of the guerrilla leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better not to give opponents a chance to question prisoners, whether it’s arranged by Sanson or if they are really arranged, and they will ask for export instead. Trouble. We have encountered four or five bandits and guerrillas since we went north. Not many times this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacking guerrillas certainly did not drop their weapons Instead, he shouted and left the avenue, fleeing into the woods and hills along the path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis, who directed the battle, noticed that the Duke of the Duke had arrived alone and hurriedly greeted several guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness! How come you came from the Central Company alone... This is too dangerous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 waved his hand: “Nothing dangerous, their combat power is not really higher than the refugees. Did the South Army’s welcoming troops arrive?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Itis nodded: "Our people have contacted them, but their commanders are not in the team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jena The commander will definitely not come. I have already heard who it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 recalls the memory that seems to have been very far away. Those memories when she was still living in a welfare home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is the one who killed my two brothers. I think, it is Bonnie Sefer - now it should be a major general." Blenheim’s saint’s, what sounds really annoying.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the words of Jenny, the young and energetic soldiers around them were falling. Head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is a shame for the late Duke and the three marquis to avenge the deceased Duke and the three Marquis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I can hear someone whispering. When I heard this, the female duke sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that is war, not private venge. The war is over. I re-emphasize the order of the emperor, including all the dukes and himself. All imperial subjects are not allowed to avenge themselves during the ceasefire period, otherwise they will be tried by the other court. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emphasizing discipline, 黛妮卡He also appeased, "But I personally believe that soon we will have the opportunity to reunite with them on the battlefield. Before that, please bear with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
