			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main road. Split runner. Crossroads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruitburg's intricate road network straddles the rushing lieutenant, he does not hesitate to pick the path that is not easy to touch people, by instinct. He seemed to be able to see the engineer's ideas every time the fortress was remodeled, as if it could estimate the choice of each commander in the face of this building structure. He didn't know if it was right or wrong, but he did not meet anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you want to escape? Why choose this road? The teenager is completely ignorant and has no energy to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the empty port appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the ship? Is there any such retreat preparation, or has it been withdrawn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He approached the port, there was some blood on the ground, and the bonfire used to warm the wounded near the pier was not extinguished. The usual bustling dock area is now empty, and the officer's restaurant standing on the small mound is also dark. The Metebexi River took away the evacuation fleet and took his hopes. After a few laps of disappointment, he squatted on the pillars of the port and embarked on the only vantage point nearby, the dock fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Lieutenant. Did you miss the retreat order? Or say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resistance The door stepped on the last step and was surprised to see the gray-haired middle-aged man sitting on the cannon box. If he doesn't see the big star on his shoulder, he probably won't recognize his commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Do you come to take me this great credit? From the first retreat signal to now, it has been more than half an hour, if you are willing to retreat The reason came so late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorryton stopped. This person should not be here anyway. Is it God that will give him a great credit to his last military career? The teenager smiled crampedly, and found a cannonbox to sit down and took a deep breath, without hesitation to say his true identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the chief disciple of Clade Lopez. I am sorry to be holding you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Crad?" Gowar suddenly laughed and laughed until he started coughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bezi ah Bezi... You have painstakingly arranged such an outstanding plan, and in the end it is not as good as this younger generation. It is not the era of our old officers. Ok, let's go, I don't mind being captured by someone." After laughing, Gowal patted the gunpowder on his body and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go? This..." Nana was somewhat embarrassed to agree, not to say that he actually rushed here in the unconscious escape. go? Where are you going? Where is he going? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goval glanced at him and suddenly stunned and slammed his palm: "Oh, I am wrong. You haven’t come yet, the boat is not there yet, right. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is no ship... The door is so thinking, but dare not say it. He failed to send any information and was designed by Constance. He hurriedly stood up and walked to the turret to look in the direction of the river - and then he stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boat. As in Govar's judgment, the ship with the flag of the river fleet is approaching the port at an incredible speed. At this wind speed, it is reasonable to say that it is not so fast... but it is so fast. All the sails were full and approached the pier under the supernatural winds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are waiting for the ship. Let's go." Gowar said nothing, and came over and handed the sabre and pistol at the waist. He. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was taken over by the heavy sword and gun, and suddenly felt the urge to cry. It should be fortunate, but he felt a bitter sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he has admitted frankly, Radz Govar is still the coach of the Free Army. He really is not qualified to capture this person. The current situation is not his design, nor the design of Clade. It is just a series of coincidences. He feels like a thief and steals the credit of others. No, maybe he was a thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-blame is interrupted by the huge pain that was uploaded by the right shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-fifth-pound lead was embedded in the shoulder blade and hit him half a shoulder. He couldn't maintain his balance, and he leaned back, and even the people took the blood down the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that all of your magicians are untrustworthy, and sure enough. Want to grab the fruits of victory?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gun in Constance’s hand should be faintly smoked, but he can’t see it. The right hand did not listen at all, the aorta blood flow not only, the door with the left hand to make up the last treatment magic filled the blood vessels, and then relieved, wiped the blood on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it time to repay the credit? It’s really fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He twitched on the ground and quietly shook his left fist. It seems that there is still room for it... But at the gunpoint, he is still convulsing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyan jumped off the horse and walked closer to the fort. He also saw the big ship that was entering Hong Kong and knew that his time was tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Major, your timing is really good, and you have been patient until the crucial moment." Govar speaks sarcasm, "from a gendarmerie deputy The third person in the headquarters, excellent performance. I read your report for so long, but never imagined that you are the traitor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I hope that as you said." The gendarmerie captain was expressionless and watched for approaching. "Of course, you can't let other people take the credit away. Before the boat is docked, let's go. Your sabre. What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m sorry, I’ve already paid it.” Gowar spread his hand and pointed to the lieutenant lying in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will get it back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that Thain came over Soledon whispered a spell, but failed to escape the sharp hearing of the major. The sharpshooter Thane’s other pistol slammed in the hand, and the lead shot hit the boy’s left hand accurately and hit the ground again, igniting a dust. The door screamed and rolled a half circle on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't struggle, Lieutenant. If you don't struggle, I will still see you in the same class. The new officer is like this, in order to grab the power. Unscrupulously, I can understand. You guys who have studied magic are not at all suffocated." The gendarmerie captain said that he took the gunpowder pellets and lead pellets from the waist to start loading...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain in the right shoulder is not important, and it is not important that the left hand uses the protective magic to force the paralysis after the bullet. Resist the door to the left hand and support, pull out your own gun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire! Shoot! Fire again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first bullet hit the left side of Constance. The major was shocked and left his two empty guns and made a beautiful squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the magic on his left hand just 'anti-ballistic'? This little devil has already estimated..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sain suddenly realized. Before he could pull out the pistol from his waist, the door that stood up and fired at his arm. Fortunately, it was unfortunate for the teenagers - the next two gunpowders were soaked and he was not hit by more bullets. Taking advantage of this time, Cheyenne rolled out, making the fourth shot only wipe his arm. Then there is another stink bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is still a chance, be sure to do the maintenance after the next water..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The door secretly cursed the poor quality gunpowder and fired the last bullet. But almost at the same time, Constance also pulled out the double-barreled handgun at the waist and handed it to the left hand. Of course, he also expected that the goalkeeper would attack his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three bullets interacted in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you are a magician, you may not be able to compare young people with people who have actually passed the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last magic with the door prevents the bleeding of the abdomen . The pain surged like a flood, as if you were in hell. If he can concentrate... if he will have even more magic...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, your reinforcements are coming soon, I can't stay Witness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard Constance use the bomb to compact the bullet. At this time, the door was calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen so many people die, and he has long been aware. The so-called military is just a murder and murdered occupation. It is a very regrettable death to die if you can be recognized by others. But...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshot finally sounded. Resistance to the door gave up hiding. Time seems to be very long and long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the limit? He hasn't talked about true love yet, and even the gifts of Shen's Day have not been received. Is his life just to die here? Death as a spy? According to Fran's teacher, 15% of the Masters will die in the first battle of their lives... Probably also like the feeling of the present. No, maybe there are more people who even die without knowing it. What if you are lucky enough to live? Going back to Lenny's home, continue to follow the crowd and live on the ground? When a third-rate magician struggles from the slums to the middle class, find a girl with a similar family? But is he so hard to practice magic for this kind of life? Or simply join the army, then kill with their own magic, and finally killed? But is the use of magic to kill people? It is said that the moment before death will become very long, it seems to be true...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the door is cranky, the smell of gunpowder in the air is gradually exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The major over there, you will go to the military court if you fight again. Is it right? I know that you want the final credit, but it is already late." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female voice inserted into his sudden death experience. He did not react at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you a Lopez man?" Constance glared at the injured wrist, his voice with an indescribable resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. The task now is not to continue to snatch credit, but to end the coup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "... Are you coming to grab the credit? It’s shameless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship of the inland fleet is slowly on the dock, but someone has arrived early On the shore. She appeared as a ghost, blocking this dirty duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original death experience does not lengthen the time. This is the first judgment of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not die. This is the second judgment of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a god who saved his last wish before his death and saved him? This is the first reasoning of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teenager looked up and looked at the fainting that appeared with the bell that ended with Christmas Eve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the Free Army General Reserve Team Intre, also known as the South East Army or the Red Shirt Army uniform. Located on the huge twin islands in the southeast, the military navy of the Republic of Intres, a never-ending sunken country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the flag of the Republic, the military uniform is red and bloody, with white white snow. Always save the free reserve team Red Shirts at a critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like the true messenger who will come to realize the wishes of the people in the legend, just the spiky cap without blood. Unlike the legend, she is a woman with a seductive curved back, a shoulder-shouldered blonde, and a sweet voice--it is like the angel that God will send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original words are returned - I don't know who is taking the credit from our people? Sorry, this important person, we received it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is her appearance and voice so familiar? This provoked some bad memories of Soledun. The third judgment is a bit tricky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
