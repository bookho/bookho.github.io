			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vii<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zalt; Fran is always very happy. Since the opening of the "Pure Gold Women's Underwear Shop" next door, his clothing store business is getting better and better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now beginning to figure out the manpower to increase production. The clothing he sold here was originally supplied by the sewing guild that has been declining. However, with the increase of female customers who visit every day, he now gradually feels that it is necessary to open a textile factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that there are not a few guests in the store, the sky is beginning to darken, and Zalt decided to fight. In this era, in addition to the catering industry, the average store strictly follows the "sunset" principle - of course, a magician with a sideline like Zalt will not "made at sunrise." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorlayton! Let everyone prepare, get the job done!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand over the storefront After his disciples and helpers, he went to check out today's turnover. Looking at the book, the manager of the black robe smiled: as usual, today is also a booming day. Unfortunately, compared to next door, his business is nothing but a big witch. Even after sunset, the underwear store is still full of bustling crowds. It has only been more than three months since its opening to the present, and its storefront has tripled. As a man who fled from the north, Zalt; Fran has been doing a six-year clothing business in Lenny; but he never thought that the clothing business could actually make it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the store has opened several branches. In order to provide enough goods for all branches, the female shop owner, Lisa, opened a sewing factory with hundreds of people, specializing in the manufacture of various women's underwear, underwear, all kinds of swimwear, and some kind of women's cotton buds... Indeed, at first these somewhat exaggerated designs were criticized, but the accusation soon became a trend. Now, the factories and shops that originally produced petticoats and shirts have begun to imitate women's underwear, otherwise they will face the collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, it seems that both Nika and Verentina have lost their petticoats and changed into underwear?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a healthy young male, Zalt does not actually dislike this kind of clothing. At least... At least, it seems to be more eye-catching than before. In any case, thanks to the huge passenger flow brought by the shop, Zalt can also pay off the debt in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrears of the ring...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He habitually touched the one in the deep pocket Small box. When he touched the small box, he always felt at ease. 30,000 pounds... oh, or, "amethyst ring with unmistakable magic." He just paid off the loan a week ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last remaining question is to give this ring to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... is it necessary to use the door; in the name of Lopez, or tell him the true identity...?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering this problem, Zalt and his disciples walked out of the store door, closed the door, and added a magic lock outside the lock. There are very few people who will unlock magic in Lenny, and Zalt never fears that he will be stolen. Anyway, he is carrying all the precious gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next door is closed. Today, your sister is no longer going to follow the door; is Lopez?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Bonnie; Sefer sat in the deepest part of the underwear store, "the idler free room", leisurely put her curvy legs on the table, with the real Huachao premium rain tea. In the Age of Enlightenment, tea was transported from the East to the West, and it was said that it took half a year; the price of Oriental tea was much higher than that of local tea. Today, she is already the chief store manager of Lenny's largest and most profitable clothing store, “Pure Gold Women's Underwear”, and naturally enjoys this high-end luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven’t been there for a long time! Anyway, the investigation tracking can’t investigate anything.” Annie snorted. “I don’t have to use the backward intelligence gathering method. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister smiled and didn't answer, but the language was punctual: "Ah, leisurely is really good. It has been hard for three months, I can finally get free. It doesn't matter if I don't need to investigate or track it. It's really good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and smiled. In the past three months, they did use a less-than-bright promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first month, they copied the female sculptures of the sculptors of the Renaissance era and used them as models to show underwear--because there is no plastic relationship in this era. . This practice of famous works has naturally caused dissatisfaction and attention from public opinion. As a result, in the major newspapers of Lenny, there has been a series of arrogant debates, "Is this new attire in line with social morality?", "Whether new attire and sanitary napkins will endanger women's health", "Does these attires conform to human aesthetics?" Articles like this keep appearing. In the southern part of the Age of Enlightenment, newspapers were extremely popular, and this topic became the most important news of the month. Liberal and conservative journalists have written to agree or disagree, and invisibly promoted underwear and sanitary napkins. At the end of this month, the storefront of “Pure Gold” has doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second month, they promised to all customers that if they can sell their underwear to other customers, they will be rewarded; if others continue to sell the underwear, The customers are all rewarded... Simply put, it is MLM. In a blink of an eye, underwear has swept up half a city, so that it has to open a separate "MLM store" to manage the MLM business. Even the illiterate middle- and low-level women have taken off their rough cloth shirts and started to try new things like bras. At the end of this month, “Pure Gold” decided to open a factory specializing in underwear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third month, they simply went to the Protestant churches, did not know what method was used to convince the nuns there to try this new outfit. "The sacred clothing blessed by the gods" quickly spreads among the nuns and becomes the standard costume of the Protestant nuns. Using the powerful influence of religion, underwear finally got a bright and straightforward identity, and a large number of high society ladies also began to use bras and sanitary napkins. Nowadays, women's underwear and sanitary napkins with the "pure gold" logo have become the famous production of Lenny, and they are being transported out by the caravans. Ordinary women who wear a bra will no longer want to wear other underwear. Women's underwear has become a "Lonnie specialty", and merchants must bring a few sets back as a gift to their wives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a reward for these actions, there is now at least one million pounds on the books of Reza; Hermont, and is still steadily increasing. This wealth, even in the free city of Lenny, is a shocking figure - it is about one-sixth of the total annual tax revenue of the entire provincial government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you fight earlier today?" Bonnie suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I want to have a rest soon today." Annie nodded. "Say, why don't you ask me for new intelligence gathering methods?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brown-haired girl removed her legs from the table and put on the expression of “thinking again and again”. “Sister, what amateur means do you use? Eight achievements are questionnaires. "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Anne grabbed her hair in disappointment. "I thought you shouldn't guess." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Amateur is amateur..." Bonnie stood up and walked out the door. "Are you going to donate to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, we are acquainted with them anyway, not afraid of it." Annie smiled. "This kind of The degree does not affect history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, would you like me to help you investigate? How do I say that I am also a half professional."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need. Only this thing, I want to do it by myself." When I said this, the expression on my sister's face was quite determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. We seem to have not returned home for two days, aren't we?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When they appeared in the store, the clerk in the store seemed to be a lot of spirit. Every clerk knows that the real boss of this store will rarely appear here, and it is actually Sefers who run here. Bonnie has been very cautious in shaping her omniscient image, which looks quite successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anne sometimes feels that her sister can't wait to put a slogan on the wall, "The big sister is watching you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!砰!砰!砰!砰!砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come back, endurance?" Seeing them coming into the door, the nuns of the welfare home, Verentina, greeted us. Sister Verentina is the general manager of the Welfare Institute. She is always very amiable, but it is terrible to launch a fire. The stunt is to pick up nearby things and swearers. The weapon specialization is the pan and the thick "the essence of divinity and faith." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come back." As usual, Zalt; Fran handed the meat and vegetables in his hands to the nun. “What happened today?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, there is a very good young lady who donated five thousand pounds to us today.” Wei Lunti’s eyebrow dance "Five thousand pounds! It is a good heart, she will be blessed by God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five thousand pounds...?!" Zalt slammed It is. This money is enough to buy a pretty good house near here... How can ordinary people be so generous? "What kind of person, Wei Lun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think...should be a pretty cute lady? Happy smile can leave people behind Very impressed, the head is taller, the figure is very good, the hair is golden..." Sister Weilun pulled her finger back and thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there still a lot of underwear for you? ‘Pure Gold’?” Hearing, Zalt suddenly spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, you already know?" Wei Lun laughed. "It’s the house next door to you. The lady said she was doing it for that store." Welfare work, I hope we can publicize their stores after receiving donations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that "pure gold" is using religious channels to promote them. Underwear... But is it necessary to use five thousand pounds? Zalt thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That should be one of the two actual leaders of that store. What else does she say?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no. But she mentioned you, saying that your recent business is good..." Verentina thought and replied. Her words were a bit flashy, but Zalt did not notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I went back to the room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go." Watching her figure disappear into the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I went to the side yard to see..." Juvenile Soledon also wanted to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Wei Lun stopped him. "I have something here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I don’t know where it was, the nun found a form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the questionnaire sent by the kind young lady this afternoon. She said that she would like to know Mr. Naimen. Their shop seems to want Fill in his independent shop as an independent department. Look at the five thousand pounds and fill it out carefully. Don't let Nana know that he might surprise him at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha?" The boy’s resounding resounded. He doesn't think that the blonde girl will be a "good young lady." Wei Lun didn't know the process he and she first met three months ago. Maybe there is any conspiracy? However, the two sisters do not seem to be looking for revenge or vengeance...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand." The teenager snorted and walked to the side yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6 rounds of 5, 25 loops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf figs are not fluently read Out of the Nika; Lopez's shooting results this time, attracted a laughter around the lively children. The full ring of 6 rounds of bullets should be 60 rings. The brown-haired, ponytailed girl’s face was white for a while, and she didn’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonica, your shooting method is wrong, you should make the bull's-eye, the crosshairs, and the gap into a line." Her father calmly reminded him, " Shooting is not like magic, as long as you think of the target you can hit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Less nonsense, father! Isn't it the ten rings?" But there is no respect in the tone of Jenny. She inserted the gun into the holster and looked very serious. The eyes were closed and the fingers of the left and right hands were clenched together, leaving only the index fingers of both hands pointing straight ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purple light gradually gathered on her fingertips. When the purple light reached the brightest, Yanika opened her eyes and focused her attention on the center of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she counts, the purple rays fly out of her hands together, and each one is exactly on the bull's eye. Until the eighth light bomb flew out, the light on the index finger disappeared. Soledon, who happened to pass through, was silent at this moment. Eight... Even if he does his best, he can only issue three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡 dialed the ponytail and stared at her father provocatively, as if to say: What is the use of firearms shooting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The complete superfluous complete spell, in fact, only the last word is a concentrated word." Klad; Lopez brows slightly wrinkled, "Really, longer singing time can be Improve the power of magic... But if you don't use the long spell to concentrate, how many can you send?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five...". Answered. On the sidelines, I guess that there is only one teenager left behind, and I dare not interrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are caught in a melee, how much spirit can you use to use magic? If you are injured? If it is difficult to locate with the naked eye? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Firearms are technological advances that give magicians the greatest In the era of no firearms, ordinary magicians do not have enough combat power because they cannot gain the advantage of warrior or Warcraft at close range; there is no powerful weapon in the world that can be used without power. But the firearms changed everything.” Clad slowly said, “If you want to surpass me, you must master the power of the firearms.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛妮卡I want to refute, but I can't find a suitable rebuttal. "I am not looking for you to learn to shoot, because you are saying that you can teach me high-level magic, I will talk to you! Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;正The 18-year-old girl in adolescence threw a hidden fog and ran back to her room. The smog that symbolizes her anger and rebellion filled the air for a while before it was smashed by Clade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, it's just adolescence." Soledon said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? You are here." It seems that the boy’s existence is now noticed, and Clade turned to face him. It’s just been hit by the attitude of her daughter, and the middle-aged man’s cold face can be seen to be a little depressed. "Do you want to learn to shoot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, please give me a lot of advice." Soledon pulled out the black revolver at the waist, aiming, Pull the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8,10,9,10,9,9,6 issued 6 of them, 55 rings." Tug once again read the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crad; Lopez’s eyes flashed in amazement: "Do you usually practice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "One thing, because I can't make eight magic bullets." The teenager was slightly happy: this is the first time he has surpassed Nika on something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a man came in from the outside; his shoulder badge carries a silver star and two vertical bars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Major Hull? How come you come here?" Clad saw him and walked over in a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man known as Major Hull approached his sergeant and whispered in his ear. A moment later, Clade; Lopez hurried away with his subordinates, as if to go to a very important date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Klad leaving, the boy boring back to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight, I have to fill in a strange question and answer volume... Maybe Ninica and Sister Wilhelm will fill it out?" He yawned. It’s really tiring, just fill it out...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Negemon; what kind of person is Lopez?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten's door; how is Lopez's character?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A generous person." "The profit is a picture, stingy, giving a small salary." Stupid pragmatist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right door; does Lopez have important people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Maybe there is in the north? Here..." "Of course, sister Weilun." "Miss Weiluntina."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is the level of magic in Lopez?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I won't watch." "No dead old (smeared)... In short, it must be Very strong." "Oh, probably that is so strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""""""""""""""""" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, should it be very rich?" "The salary is very good." "Recently should be in the ring of debt... I remember the last time you asked about the ring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What is the birthday of Lopez?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Summer solstice? June 21st." "I don't know." "Asked three times, each time is different." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... In short, most of the questions have got a meaningless answer. Waiting for Anne; Sefer takes the answer and should feel painful for the donation of 5,000 pounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure black carriage with a "pure gold underwear" eye-catching ad, stopped in front of the big house on the edge of the city's three districts. The mansion took up about half of the street, backed by the Central moat and the wall. There is a small courtyard in the house, and the center is a four-story mansion. Bonnie bought it for £150,000 a month ago. The former pirates were placed in the yard, and Leonard and Kazmi served as the deputy guards - the former pirates still know the tricks of the thieves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of research is Leisa doing recently?" Just after getting out of the car, Anne saw Leisha; the room in Hermonte has various colors. The light is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still doing some magical manufacturing things, Ganda’s material seems to be renewed into a fine gold alloy. It’s also rich for alchemists. It’s difficult.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked toward the big house, waiting for the housekeeper at the door to give Bonnie the general manager a copy of the accounts of each branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie flipped a copy of the account and raised her eyebrows: "I am going back to the room, my sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is that waiting for you to have a meal?" Annie asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I will let the servant send the meal to my room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people Separated from the stairs on the second floor, Bonnie returned to her room alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she entered the room, she opened the book and unlocked the encryption magic on the text. This kind of magic can add a certain number of pages in a book, only those who know the password and the number of pages can write and read; those who don't know the password need to remove the magic, they need much higher power, repair and Release the time. The history of espionage in modern times is actually a duel between magic and hidden magic. For Bonnie, who has two hundred years of advanced magical technology, most of the espionage methods of this era can be easily broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of intelligence, she and her sister’s point of view are the same: to control the change of history, the most important thing is intelligence - especially when they have been buried There are a lot of variables now. Anne is used to going straight, and Bonnie is used to stealth. Bonnie didn't want her sister to know her intelligence network: on the one hand, for Anne, and on the other, for the intelligence network itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using these three months, and the actual managerial status of the pure gold underwear store, Bonnie; Sefer established a rough intelligence network. Most of the information was street talks and rumors, and a small part came from the intelligence dealers, and then was collected by reliable people through MLM and the network of pure gold underwear. Bonnie used the money, spiritual magic and her own Protestant pastor to control the intelligence network, and she was somewhat confident. She is used to acting in the dark because she has done the same job in later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
