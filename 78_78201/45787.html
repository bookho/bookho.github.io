			<div id="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu side weighed all the things in front of what was going on, and was always ready to pull Lv Xiaoyu to run the road, as far as running can not run ... can only say that the best.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the group of people wearing black trench coats did not seem to be entangled with them. It was not like the standard bad guys in the TV series. They did not indiscriminately kill nothing, but went straight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lu Shu was a little relieved. Is the other party really a government official?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered the video and people who had disappeared before the spiritual events... Is this performer also related to that kind of thing? When did the government have more uniforms in black trench coats... It looks pretty good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party suddenly presents a document of a mysterious department at this time, it is not true that Lu Shu really believes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fire brigade that the other party said... even if...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a thing, Lu Shulu Xiaoyu, the big one and the younger, are not in the mood to continue to watch the temple fair, go home.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she left, Lu Shu looked down and meditated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lv Xiaoyu looked up at him and said: "Lv Shu, what are you thinking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You told me that my brother can die!" Lu Shu had a big fire at that time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do we have blood relationship?" Lu Xiaoyu looked disdainful, and the little man was big.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, suddenly a young man stopped Lu Shu and said with a smile: "You just came out from the backstage, can you tell me what happened inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu police said: "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, my name is Zhiwei, I am very happy to meet you," the handsome young man smiled and introduced himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How happy are you?” Lu Shu asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man named Zhiwei almost urinated. How can this cargo be so unconventional? !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount... In short, I am very happy..." However, Zhiwei just wanted to continue to explain, and he saw that the young boy on the opposite side ignored him. He took the cute little girl and left. The little girl was still beside him. Jumping...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call... I don't care about you!" Zhiwei is a little helpless, or go and see for yourself. There should be a lot of eyewitnesses inside. Those people should be better than this boy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking for a while, Lv looked back at the back of the young man and frowned. Lu Xiaoyu calmly said: "Lv Shu, you are a little bit wrong today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small fish, if you say that there are a lot more people in the world than normal people, what do you do?" Lu Shu asked, if the performer really has problems, then the incitement in his heart is Not representing... I have problems with myself?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, it is more powerful than them," Lu Xiaoyu said of course.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to it, Lu Shu indulged for a moment, then smiled like a thought of something: "You said it is really simple, but it makes sense, let's go, go home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lv Xiaoyu said from his own self: "Lv Shu, your body is so weak, you can't do it. If you play basketball with your classmates for five minutes, you will not be able to breathe. But it doesn't matter, you can't, but I can, I will protect it later. You, you will just cook for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh,” Lu Shu said with a black face: “Inexplicable self-confidence.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Lu Shu and Lv Xiaoyu lived was in the No. 4 Courtyard of Luocheng Administrative Office. This is the legendary municipal party committee. However, it is already a matter of decades. Now the No. 4 Courtyard is a recognized slum in the present. During this time, it was still a small bungalow on the first floor. There was no gas and no heating in the ragged, and no one said that it was a slum.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu, they live here is a rented house, a small square of 80 square meters, 500 yuan per month in this small three-line city, excluding water and electricity. The landlord did not intend to sell the house. He simply wanted to wait for the demolition to have a good compensation condition.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has long been said that it will be ruined. The result has been said for several years, because the residents in the yard are more difficult.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people dislike this, Lu Shu is quite like it, because there is a small yard in front of every bungalow, probably there is a ten-flat, and can also plant some things like garlic, leeks, etc. After all, it also needs money to buy. what.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lv Shu lacks money because he is an orphan. When he is young, he is thrown at the door of the orphanage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lv Xiaoyu is also.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, orphans grow up to 16 years old in an orphanage. If no one adopts it, they will have to enter the society to become self-reliant. This is the case of Lu Shu.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is too imaginary from a young age, which one will be willing to adopt a sick scorpion to go back?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lv Xiaoyu sneaked out of himself, and the orphanage was accustomed to it. In this era, the little orphans couldn’t stand the life of the orphanage and sneak out. The situation of stealing things and robbing things was too much, so now even the police I am too lazy to report.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orphanage is not as responsible as the ‘model orphanage’ in the movie. If the child ran out, it’s dead or alive. Who cares so much?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu wants to send Lu Xiaoyu back to the orphanage. After all, she is in a good condition and she is still young. Some people are willing to adopt her, but Lu Xiaoyu will run out again every time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, Lu Shu is used to it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lv Xiaoyu is a bit abnormal. She is a bit precocious compared to her peers. Of course, Lu Shu may not be normal. It is not usually reflected, but today's dialogue with Zhiwei is only a microcosm.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house they rented was in the innermost row of a row of bungalows. When passing a square, a neighbor was licking Chinese medicine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lv Shuxiao knows that this family has an old man who is in the torment of illness all the year round. This neighbor is also the daughter-in-law of the old man. The disease seems to be hereditary. The old man has not left yet. The son was tortured away by the pain. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter-in-law is also filial, and has been taking care of the elderly for so many years. Although Lin Biao seems to have more than forty, and there are many wrinkles on his face, Lu Lu can still see from the contours of the other's face how the other side is young.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a woman is willing to take care of her husband's father alone. This kind of person in this society is really rare.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lin Yan, good evening," Lu Shu said with a big smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small tree and small fish, you are coming back," Daxiao smiled and accepted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Lu Shu was ready to pull Lu Xiaoyu back home, Lu Xiaoyu suddenly fell down and looked at the medicine pot on the small coal stove: "Lin, can I drink some?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lin Yi Le: "This is a medicine, a small fish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lv Xiaoyu thought for a moment: "Then I will take a sip!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu’s face was dark at the time: “Walk away, add something to chaos, you’ll drink medicine from others!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tai Te is a shame, Lu Shu, this age, is the time when the juvenile self-esteem grows, with such a snack goods, it is simply!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese medicine smells bad, is it good? !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ao," Lu Xiaoyu's heart is unwilling to continue to go inside, step by step back, obviously there is still a little bit of that pot of Chinese medicine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a low cough in the room behind Lin Biao, and the old man sighed: "Young is so good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lin Biao smiled and said: "Yes, young is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lv Xiaoyu no longer looks back at the pot of Chinese medicine, but looks at Lu Shu with his eyes: "Lv Shu, I want to eat instant noodles, braised beef!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
