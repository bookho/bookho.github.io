			<div id="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to eat instant noodles, I will cook you noodles to eat," Lu Shu reluctantly, so cold days still come to buy instant noodles, this big New Year wants to buy instant noodles have to go through two streets 24 Hours Zhang Donglai convenience store.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The noodles you cook have nothing to taste, I don't want to eat, you go buy me instant noodles!" Lu Xiaoyu is not happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't go," Lu Shu said, changing shoes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you knocked the little walnut on your neck and gave it to me," Lu Xiaoyu's eyes flashed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knocking your sister, don't you remember this?" Lu Shu is a little bit worse. The stuff on his neck is not a walnut, but the texture above looks like it is only black. Some are not normal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is abandoning in the orphanage with myself, and it seems unremarkable. Although Lu Shu often criticized the employees in the orphanage for being irresponsible, Lu Shu must admit that their character is still very correct, otherwise it will not be left with him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is of no use to others, but it is a small idea for Lu Shu.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case...he said that if his parents wanted to find him again through this, isn't this a proof?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has no concept of the word "parent", he has lived well for so many years.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a parent came to the orphanage to adopt a child, and the dean took his hand to the strange couple, he also had a look at the word of the parents.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the other party disliked his frailty, the expectation disappeared.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I really don't need my parents anymore. Lu Shu occasionally thinks this way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it’s time to throw it away... it’s still a bit unwilling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will say that this stuff must not be eaten again," Lu Shu said with no anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I dare to drink other people's Chinese medicine, this is something I dare not eat!" Lu Xiaoyu is not convinced.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu was urinating at the time, and what you said is very reasonable!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lv Shu, you have changed, you have not been like this before!" Lu Xiaoyu calmly said: "You helped me last year..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu’s face was dark at the time: “Lv Xiaoyu, you are enough... I will tell you, if you look at the love soap opera, I will watch TV!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you have to pay the landlord 800 yuan," Lu Xiaoyu calmly analyzed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to go, I will buy you instant noodles!" Lu Shu turned and went out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu, standing at the door, tightened his neckline, and the winter in Los Angeles was a bit cold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly I felt a little moist on the eyelids. He looked up and didn't know when the sky began to float fine snow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shredded snow is like a velvet, slowly falling from the sky to the earth, floating on the ground, on the eaves, on Lu's body.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the relationship between myself and Lu Xiaoyu so good? Lu Shu stood at the door and looked at the white snow falling from the sky, but he was not very clear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the day of his 14-year-old Chinese New Year fever in the orphanage, Lu Xiaoyu poured himself a cup of hot water? When he was bullied by other people in the orphanage, did Lu Xiaoyu always call the dean for himself?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe everyone is helpless, holding a group to warm up?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is Lu Xiaoyu who trusts him unreasonably and relies on him to give him an inexplicable sense of responsibility.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want him?" Lu Shu smiled. Since there are no parents in the world who have no relatives, what is wrong with one more sister? Even this sister gave him a noisy moth all day long.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter is darker in the winter, because it is the third day of the New Year's Day. There are no pedestrians on the street. Only some trucks that pass by occasionally are still running in the New Year. It is not easy for everyone to live.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, Lu Shu suddenly remembered the thing that the acrobatic performer was taken away during the day. Will the performer be the versatile person who is guessing online now? Does the person who cultivated the Tao really exist?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why all this has been a fantasy in the past, but this year suddenly seems to be coming into people's lives right away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there is still another person who makes Lu Shu remember deeply. He is the young man who knows Zhiwei after he came out of the background.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu thought about the more embarrassing world that might exist, and was a bit distracted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sound of the wind was like a broken, and it was swept in front of Lu Shu. The snow in the sky was particularly splendid under the two huge lights.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the light came to itself, when Lu Shu looked back, the glaring lights made him dizzy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, he was able to recognize that it was a huge truck, roaring like a beast.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp sound of the brake pads rubbing against the tires and the sharp sound of the tires gripping together sounded together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the beast has lost control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the time lapse between the moments, the air was squeezed almost twisted, in this dark night, Lu Shu has been hit by a huge beast.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body was like a broken kite that broke the snow curtain behind him. The world of Lu Shu seems to have become slow. I don't know why he suddenly remembered that someone would recall his life in a moment before he died.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu closed his eyes and wanted to seize the momentary opportunity to see what the parents who sent themselves to the orphanage looked like... but nothing was seen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Shu feels that his life is dying, just as all the good things in the world will eventually die.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the pendant on his chest suddenly turned into dust, no, but the hard shell that Lu Xiaoyu could not open with a hammer, turned into a powder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finally revealed something inside that couldn’t be said, it was a bit like an almond, and it was a bit like a star.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star merged into his body, and as the blood river drifted, he finally stayed in the palm of Lu Shu. After it finally spit out a warm current, it completely disappeared into the perception of Lu Shu.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm current is like the ocean going from south to north in the Pacific Ocean, sinking into the heart of Lushu.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong heartbeat, so a white flame in the heart re-ignited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the blazing flame that had been extinguished in his body but re-burned, the joy of reunion for a long time has never been so refreshing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blazing flame should belong to him. It seems that since the appearance of the heavens and the earth, this is the truth that is immortal.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Lu Shu fell to the ground and no longer heard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truck driver jumped out of the car and looked at Lu Shu on the ground with a look of hesitation. He regretted that if he was not driving himself, he would never have such a thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver slowly moved to the teenager on the ground. His car bought all the risks, and millions of them could afford it, and they would not be saved. Suddenly the boy moved a bit and the driver’s master walked over in amazement.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result has not yet come to the front, I saw Lu Shu slowly propped up his body, his face is bloody: "You have a big event!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
